## 🏗️ Architecture & Technical Excellence

### MVVM Compliance

**Layer Separation**:
```
Presentation Layer (UI)

- ✅ Proper state management with StateFlow
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Repository pattern throughout

### Dependency Injection

**New Registrations**:

- Loose coupling maintained
- Easy mocking for unit tests
- Lifecycle management handled

### Data Persistence

**Firestore Collections**:
```
bookmarks/{userId}
  └─ materialIds: [array of bookmarked material IDs]

users/{userId}/data/profile
  └─ fullName, age, gender, typeOfEntry, subscriptionTier
```

**SharedPreferences**:
```
app_theme.xml
  └─ theme: LIGHT | DARK | SYSTEM
```

### Memory Management

**Best Practices Implemented**:
- ✅ Flows properly closed with `awaitClose`
- ✅ ViewModelScope for coroutines
- ✅ No manual listener removal needed
- ✅ Firestore listeners auto-cleanup
- ✅ No memory leaks detected
