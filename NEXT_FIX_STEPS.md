# 🔍 Next Diagnostic Steps - Google Sign-In Still Failing

## ✅ What's Confirmed Working:
- SHA-1 is correctly added: `bd:9b:85:fe:93:80:30:5e:ea:62:1c:c3:51:82:ab:95:9f:66:ec:05`
- google-services.json is up to date
- Package name matches: `com.ssbmax`

## 🚨 Most Likely Issue: Google Sign-In Provider Not Enabled

### Step 1: Enable Google Sign-In in Firebase Console

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. **Select** your `ssbmax` project
3. **Click** "Authentication" in the left sidebar (🔐 icon)
4. **Click** "Sign-in method" tab at the top
5. **Look for "Google" in the providers list**

### What You Should See:

```
Sign-in providers
─────────────────────────────
Google                [Enabled]  ← Should say "Enabled"
Email/Password        Disabled
Phone                 Disabled
```

### If It Says "Disabled":

1. **Click on "Google"** (the row)
2. **Toggle "Enable" switch** to ON
3. **Set Project public-facing name**: `SSBMax`
4. **Set Project support email**: (select your email from dropdown)
5. **Click "Save"**

## 🔧 Step 2: Verify Web Client ID Exists

Your `google-services.json` shows:

**Android Client (Type 1):** ✅
```
YOUR_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

**Web Client (Type 3):** ✅
```
YOUR_WEB_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

This looks correct!

## 🧪 Step 3: Check API Restrictions (Google Cloud Console)

Sometimes the Google Sign-In API itself is restricted. Let's verify:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com
2. **Select** the project associated with Firebase (should be `ssbmax-49e68`)
3. **Click** "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
4. **Find** your Android client: `YOUR_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID`
5. **Click** on it to view details
6. **Check "API restrictions"** section:
   - Should be **"Don't restrict key"** OR
   - Should include **"Google Sign-In API"** in allowed APIs

### If Restricted:

- Select **"Don't restrict key"** (for development/testing)
- Click **"Save"**
- Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate

## 🔍 Step 4: Enhanced Logging

Let's add even more detailed logging to see exactly what error Google Sign-In is returning:

Run this command to see ALL logs:

```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "GoogleAuth|GoogleSignIn|GoogleApiClient|Auth|SignIn"
```

Then try signing in and look for error messages like:
- `DEVELOPER_ERROR`
- `API_NOT_CONNECTED`
- `SIGN_IN_FAILED`
- `ERROR_CODE: 10, 12, 16`

---

## 🚨 Common Error Codes:

| Error Code | Meaning | Solution |
|------------|---------|----------|
| 10 | DEVELOPER_ERROR | SHA-1 mismatch or not added |
| 12 | SIGN_IN_CANCELLED | User cancelled (not your issue) |
| 16 | NETWORK_ERROR | Network problem |
| 7 | NETWORK_ERROR | Timeout |

Since your error is `resultCode=0` immediately, it's likely error code **10** even though SHA-1 is added.

---

## 🔧 Step 5: Verify Package Name in Build Config

Let's make sure the package name in your app matches Firebase:

```bash
cd /Users/sunil/Downloads/SSBMax
grep "applicationId" app/build.gradle.kts
```

Should output: `applicationId = "com.ssbmax"`

If it's different (like `com.example.ssbmax`), that's the problem!

---

## 🔄 Step 6: Complete Clean Rebuild

After enabling Google Sign-In and checking restrictions:

```bash
cd /Users/sunil/Downloads/SSBMax

# Completely clean
./gradle.sh clean

# Delete build folders
rm -rf app/build
rm -rf build
rm -rf .gradle

# Rebuild
./gradle.sh installDebug

# Clear app data
adb shell pm clear com.ssbmax

# Watch detailed logs
adb logcat -c
adb logcat | grep -E "LoginScreen|GoogleAuth|GoogleSignIn|Auth"

# Now try signing in
```

---

## 🎯 Step 7: Try Different Google Account

Sometimes specific Google accounts have issues:

1. Make sure you're using a **personal Google account** (not G Suite/Workspace)
2. Try a different Google account if available
3. Some corporate accounts block third-party sign-ins

---

## 📊 Expected Logs After Fix:

### Current (Failing):
```
LoginScreen: Google Sign-In button clicked
LoginScreen: Launching Google Sign-In intent
LoginScreen: Google Sign-In result: resultCode=0
```

### After Fix (Working):
```
LoginScreen: Google Sign-In button clicked
LoginScreen: Launching Google Sign-In intent
GoogleSignInClient: Sign-in intent launched
[Account picker appears]
GoogleSignInClient: Got account: user@gmail.com
LoginScreen: Google Sign-In result: resultCode=-1
AuthViewModel: handleGoogleSignInResult called
```

---

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

### Test with Even More Detailed Logs:

```bash
adb shell setprop log.tag.GoogleSignIn VERBOSE
adb shell setprop log.tag.GoogleAuth VERBOSE
adb logcat | grep -E "LoginScreen|Google"
```

Then try signing in and share the complete output.

## 🎯 Most Likely Culprits (Ranked):

1. **Google Sign-In Provider Not Enabled** (80% probability)
   - Fix: Enable in Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method

2. **API Key Restrictions** (15% probability)
   - Fix: Check Google Cloud Console → Credentials → Remove restrictions

3. **Package Name Mismatch** (4% probability)
   - Fix: Verify applicationId matches Firebase

4. **Cache Issue** (1% probability)
   - Fix: Complete clean rebuild + clear app data

## 📋 Quick Checklist

Run through this checklist:

- [ ] **Firebase Console** → Authentication → Sign-in method → Google = **Enabled** ✓
- [ ] **Google Cloud Console** → Credentials → Android client → API restrictions = **None** ✓
- [ ] **Package name**: `com.ssbmax` matches in both Firebase and app ✓
- [ ] **SHA-1** added and matches: `bd:9b:85:...` ✓
- [ ] **google-services.json** downloaded and replaced ✓
- [ ] **Clean rebuild** performed ✓
- [ ] **App data cleared** ✓

Let me know:
1. Is Google Sign-In **Enabled** in Firebase Authentication?
2. What do the detailed logs show when you try signing in?
3. What's your `applicationId` in `build.gradle.kts`?
