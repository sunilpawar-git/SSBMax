## 🎯 Release Overview

## ✅ What's Fixed

### Issue #1: Error Display on Empty Collection
**Problem**: When submissions collection was empty, Firebase index errors appeared  
**Impact**: Users saw technical errors  
**Solution**: Detect index errors and show friendly empty state

### Issue #2: Poor User Guidance
**Problem**: Empty state didn't guide users to take tests  
**Impact**: Users didn't know the next step  
**Solution**: Added "Take a Test" button with navigation
