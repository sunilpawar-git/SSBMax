# üîê API Key Restriction Guide - Quick 15 Minute Task

## Why Restrict API Keys?

Even with fresh keys, **unrestricted** API keys can be used by anyone from any app if they get leaked. Restrictions ensure your keys ONLY work from your official app.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Required: 15 minutes

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Go to Google Cloud Console
- URL: https://console.cloud.google.com/
- Select project: **ssbmax-49e68**

### 2. Navigate to API Credentials
- Click **APIs & Services** (hamburger menu on left)
- Click **Credentials**

### 3. Find Your API Keys
You should see several keys. For EACH key:

#### For Android API Keys:
```
‚úÖ Application restrictions:
   - Select: "Android apps"
   - Package name: com.ssbmax
   - SHA-1 fingerprint: [Get from step 4 below]

‚úÖ API restrictions:
   - Select: "Restrict key"
   - Enable only these:
     ‚òë Firebase Authentication API
     ‚òë Cloud Firestore API  
     ‚òë Firebase Cloud Messaging API
     ‚òë Firebase Installations API
     ‚òë Token Service API
     (Uncheck everything else)

Click [Save]
```

#### For Web API Keys (if any):
```
‚úÖ Application restrictions:
   - Select: "HTTP referrers"
   - Add referrers:
     - localhost:* (for testing)
     - Your domain (if you have a web version)

‚úÖ API restrictions:
   - Select: "Restrict key"
   - Enable only APIs you use

Click [Save]
```

### 4. Get Your SHA-1 Fingerprint

#### Option A: From Terminal
```bash
cd /Users/sunil/Downloads/SSBMax

# For debug keystore
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android | grep SHA1
```

#### Option B: From Android Studio
1. Open your project in Android Studio
2. Click **Gradle** tab (right side)
3. Navigate to: **app** ‚Üí **Tasks** ‚Üí **android** ‚Üí **signingReport**
4. Double-click **signingReport**
5. Copy the **SHA1** value from the output

#### Option C: From Firebase Console
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí General
2. Scroll to "Your apps" ‚Üí "SSBMax Android"
3. Click "Add fingerprint"
4. The instructions there show how to get SHA-1

### 5. Verify Restrictions Applied

After saving, you should see:
- ‚úÖ "Android apps" badge next to the key
- ‚úÖ "Restricted" badge for API restrictions

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Logged into Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Selected ssbmax-49e68 project
- [ ] Navigated to APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
- [ ] Got SHA-1 fingerprint from debug keystore
- [ ] For each API key:
  - [ ] Set Application restriction to "Android apps"
  - [ ] Added package name: com.ssbmax
  - [ ] Added SHA-1 fingerprint
  - [ ] Set API restrictions to only needed APIs
  - [ ] Clicked Save
- [ ] Verified restrictions show "Android apps" and "Restricted" badges
- [ ] Tested app still works (build and run)

---

## What If I Get SHA-1 Later?

If you don't have your SHA-1 handy right now:

1. **Skip this for now** - your app is secure with new keys
2. **Do it later** when you have your keystore set up
3. **For now**: At minimum, set API restrictions (Step 3) even without SHA-1

---

## Testing After Restrictions

```bash
cd /Users/sunil/Downloads/SSBMax

# Clean build
./gradlew clean

# Build and run
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Your app should work exactly the same. If it doesn't:
- Double-check package name matches: `com.ssbmax`
- Verify SHA-1 was added correctly
- Make sure all required APIs are enabled

---

## Expected Outcome

**Before**: Keys work from any app, any device, anywhere  
**After**: Keys ONLY work from apps with package `com.ssbmax` and your SHA-1

This is like putting a lock on your API keys! üîê

---

## Priority

**High** - Do this within 24 hours for best security practice.

Even though you've rotated keys, restrictions are an essential security layer.

*This task complements the key rotation you already completed.*
