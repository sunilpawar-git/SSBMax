# üö® Fix "Requests from this Android client are blocked" Error

## Error Message
```
Firebase authentication error: An internal error has occurred. 
[ Requests from this Android client application com.ssbmax are blocked. ]
```

## üéØ The Issue

This error means Firebase is actively **blocking your Android app**, not just the API key. This is different from API key restrictions!

## ‚úÖ Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Check OAuth Consent Screen Status

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console OAuth Consent Screen**:
   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=ssbmax-49e68

2. **Check Publishing Status**:
   - If status is **"Testing"**: You need to add your Google account as a test user
   - If status is **"In Production"**: Should work for everyone

3. **If in Testing Mode**:
   - Scroll to **"Test users"** section
   - Click **"+ ADD USERS"**
   - Add your Google account email
   - Click **Save**

---

### Solution 2: Verify OAuth Web Client ID in google-services.json

The issue might be that the Web Client ID in your `google-services.json` doesn't match what's registered.

#### Check Your google-services.json:
```json
"oauth_client": [
  {
    "client_id": "YOUR_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "client_type": 1,
    "android_info": {
      "package_name": "com.ssbmax",
      "certificate_hash": "bd9b85fe9380305eea621cc35182ab959f66ec05"
    }
  },
  {
    "client_id": "YOUR_WEB_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "client_type": 3  ‚Üê This is the Web Client ID
  }
]
```

#### Verify Web Client ID in Google Cloud:

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=ssbmax-49e68
2. Under **"OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"**, find the **Web client** entry
3. Verify the Client ID matches: `YOUR_WEB_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com`

---

### Solution 3: Regenerate OAuth 2.0 Credentials

The OAuth client might be corrupted or misconfigured.

#### Steps:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Credentials**:
   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=ssbmax-49e68

2. **Find "Web client (auto created by Google Service)"**

3. **Check if it exists and has the correct settings**:
   - Authorized JavaScript origins: (should be empty or have Firebase domains)
   - Authorized redirect URIs: (should have Firebase auth domains)

4. **If Missing or Wrong**:
   - Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method
   - Click on Google provider
   - Click **Save** (this will regenerate the Web client)
   - Download fresh google-services.json
   - Replace your local file

---

### Solution 4: Check if API Key Itself is Blocked

Even though you have restrictions, the key itself might be blocked.

1. **Go to Google Cloud Credentials**:
   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=ssbmax-49e68

2. **Click on "Android key (auto created by Firebase)"**

3. **Scroll to top and check if there's a warning banner** saying:
   - "This API key is blocked"
   - "This API key has been flagged for security review"

4. **If blocked**:
   - You may need to create a new API key
   - Or contact Google Cloud support

---

### Solution 5: Wait for Propagation (Again)

Since you just added the SHA-1 and applied restrictions:

- **Wait**: 15-30 minutes (longer than the initial 10 minutes)
- **Why**: Firebase and Google Cloud sync can be slow
- **Then**: Try again

---

### Solution 6: Check SHA-1 Format in Google Cloud

I noticed in your screenshot, the SHA-1 format might have an issue.

#### Your SHA-1:
```
bd:9b:85:fe:93:80:30:5e:ea:62:1c:c3:51:82:ab:95:9f:66:ec:d5
```

#### In google-services.json (without colons):
```
bd9b85fe9380305eea621cc35182ab959f66ec05
```

#### But I see in screenshot it shows:
```
BD:9B:85:FE:93:80:30:5E:EA:62:1C:C3:51:82:AB:95:9F:66:EC:D5
```

**Try this**:
1. Delete the existing SHA-1 from Google Cloud API key restrictions
2. Re-add it in **UPPERCASE**:
   ```
   BD:9B:85:FE:93:80:30:5E:EA:62:1C:C3:51:82:AB:95:9F:66:EC:D5
   ```
3. Save
4. Wait 10 minutes
5. Test

## üîç Most Likely Cause Based on Your Error

The error **"Requests from this Android client application are blocked"** usually means:

### Primary Suspect: OAuth Consent Screen in "Testing" Mode ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

If your OAuth consent screen is in **Testing mode** and your Google account is not in the test users list, Firebase will block the authentication.

**Check this first!**

---

## üß™ Quick Test Steps

### 1. Check OAuth Consent Screen:
```
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=ssbmax-49e68
2. Check "Publishing status"
3. If "Testing": Add your Google account email to "Test users"
4. Click Save
5. Wait 5 minutes
6. Try authentication again
```

### 2. If Still Blocked - Download Fresh Config:
```bash
# 1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Your apps
# 2. Download fresh google-services.json
# 3. Replace local file

cd /Users/sunil/Downloads/SSBMax
# Replace app/google-services.json with the fresh download

# 4. Rebuild
./gradle.sh clean installDebug

# 5. Test authentication
```

## üéØ Action Plan (Do These Now)

### Step 1: Check OAuth Consent Screen (MOST LIKELY FIX) ‚≠ê
```
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=ssbmax-49e68
```
- Check if in "Testing" mode
- If yes: Add your Google account to "Test users"
- Save and wait 5 minutes

### Step 2: Try SHA-1 in Uppercase
```
Delete current SHA-1 from Google Cloud
Re-add as: BD:9B:85:FE:93:80:30:5E:EA:62:1C:C3:51:82:AB:95:9F:66:EC:D5
Save and wait 10 minutes
```

### Step 3: Rebuild and Test
```bash
cd /Users/sunil/Downloads/SSBMax
./gradle.sh clean installDebug
# Then test Google Sign-In
```

## üí° Why This Error Happens

The error **"Requests from this Android client application are blocked"** occurs when:

1. ‚ùå OAuth consent screen is in Testing mode and user not added
2. ‚ùå OAuth Web Client ID is missing or misconfigured
3. ‚ùå API key itself is blocked by Google
4. ‚ùå SHA-1 fingerprint format mismatch
5. ‚ùå Restrictions haven't fully propagated (30+ minutes)

**Based on your configuration, #1 (OAuth Consent Screen) is the most likely!**

---

## üÜò If Nothing Works

### Last Resort Options:

1. **Create New OAuth 2.0 Credentials**:
   - Delete existing Web client in Google Cloud
   - Regenerate in Firebase Console
   - Download fresh google-services.json

2. **Create New API Key**:
   - In Google Cloud Console ‚Üí Credentials
   - Create new Android API key
   - Apply same restrictions
   - Download fresh google-services.json

3. **Check Google Cloud Project Settings**:
   - Verify project is not disabled
   - Check billing status
   - Verify APIs are enabled

---

**Start with checking OAuth Consent Screen - that's the #1 cause of this error!** ‚≠ê
