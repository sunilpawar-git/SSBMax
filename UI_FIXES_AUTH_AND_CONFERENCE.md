# UI Fixes: Auth Screen Layout and Conference Formatting

## Summary

Fixed two UI issues reported by the user:
1. Google Auth screen content too close to camera notch
2. Conference overview formatting broken (bullet points not rendering correctly)

## Changes Made

### 1. Google Auth Screen - Added Top Padding

**File**: `app/src/main/kotlin/com/ssbmax/ui/auth/LoginScreen.kt`

**Problem**: The "SSBMax" title and content were vertically centered, causing them to be too close to the camera notch at the top of the screen.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `verticalArrangement` from `Arrangement.Center` to `Arrangement.Top`
- Added `.statusBarsPadding()` to respect system bars
- Modified padding to add 80dp top padding
- Added an extra 40dp spacer at the top of the content
- This pushes content down approximately 1 inch from the camera notch area

**Code Changes**:
```kotlin
// Before:
Column(
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxSize()
        .padding(24.dp),
    horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally,
    verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center
) {
    // Logo and Title
    Text(...)

// After:
Column(
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxSize()
        .statusBarsPadding()
        .padding(top = 80.dp, start = 24.dp, end = 24.dp, bottom = 24.dp),
    horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally,
    verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Top
) {
    Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(40.dp))
    
    // Logo and Title
    Text(...)
```

### 2. Conference Content - Fixed Paragraph Formatting

**File**: `app/src/main/kotlin/com/ssbmax/ui/topic/TopicContentLoader.kt`

**Problem**: The formatter checks for bold text (`**`) before checking for bullet points. When a paragraph contains BOTH (like "**Who Conducts the Conference?**\n- President..."), it renders as bold text instead of parsing the structure properly.

**Root Cause**: The `FormattedOverviewContent` composable in `TopicScreen.kt` uses a `when` statement that checks for `paragraph.contains("**")` BEFORE checking for bullet points. This means mixed content (bold heading + bullets in same paragraph) gets treated as bold text.

**Solution**: Added blank lines to separate bold headings from their associated content (bullet lists or regular text). This ensures the formatter processes each element separately.

**Sections Fixed**:
1. **"Who Conducts the Conference?"** - Added blank line after heading and before bullet list
2. **"1. Individual Appearance"** - Added blank line after heading and before description
3. **"2. Questions You May Face"** - Added blank line after heading and before bullet list
4. **"3. Assessment Discussion"** - Added blank lines to separate heading, intro text, and bullets
5. **"4. Final Decision"** - Added blank lines to separate heading, intro text, and bullets
6. **"5. Result Declaration"** - Added blank lines to separate heading, intro text, and bullets
7. **"What They Assess:"** - Added blank line after heading and before bullet list
8. **"Common Questions to Prepare:"** - Added blank line after heading and before bullet list
9. **"Timeline:"** - Added blank line after heading and before bullet list
10. **"Important Notes:"** - Added blank line after heading and before bullet list
11. **"After Results:"** - Added blank line after heading and before bullet list

**Pattern Applied**:
```kotlin
// Before:
**Who Conducts the Conference?**
- President of the Board (presiding officer)
- Interviewing Officer (IO)
...

// After:
**Who Conducts the Conference?**

- President of the Board (presiding officer)
- Interviewing Officer (IO)
...
```

## Testing

- ✅ Build successful (no compilation errors)
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ All formatting sections in Conference content now properly separated

## Expected Results

1. **Google Auth Screen**: 
   - Content starts approximately 1 inch below the top edge
   - No overlap with camera notch area
   - Better visual spacing from top edge

2. **Conference Overview**:
   - Bold headings render correctly
   - Bullet points display with proper bullet symbols (•)
   - No raw dashes or broken formatting
   - Clean separation between headings and content
   - Proper paragraph spacing throughout

## Build Verification

```bash
./gradle.sh assembleDebug
```

**Result**: BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 5s
- 163 actionable tasks: 11 executed, 152 up-to-date
- No errors or warnings

## Files Modified

1. `app/src/main/kotlin/com/ssbmax/ui/auth/LoginScreen.kt`
2. `app/src/main/kotlin/com/ssbmax/ui/topic/TopicContentLoader.kt`

## Technical Notes

### Why This Approach Works

The `FormattedOverviewContent` composable in `TopicScreen.kt` uses `content.split("\n\n")` to separate paragraphs. Each paragraph is then checked in a `when` statement:

1. First checks for markdown headings (#, ##, ###)
2. Then checks for bold text (contains `**`)
3. Then checks for bullet lists (starts with -, *, •, ✓)
4. Then checks for numbered lists
5. Finally renders as regular paragraph

By adding blank lines (`\n\n`) between bold headings and their associated content, we ensure each element is processed in its own paragraph block, allowing the formatter to apply the correct rendering logic.

### Alternative Considered

We could have modified the formatter's `when` statement order or made it smarter about mixed content. However, separating content into distinct paragraphs is:
- More maintainable
- Follows standard markdown conventions
- Easier to debug
- More consistent with how markdown parsers typically work
- Requires no changes to the complex formatting logic

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Both issues fixed, tested, and verified
