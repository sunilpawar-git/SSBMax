## üìä **Expected Results After Fix**

### Before (Current - Failing):
```
LoginScreen: Google Sign-In button clicked
LoginScreen: Launching Google Sign-In intent
LoginScreen: Google Sign-In result: resultCode=0  ‚ùå
LoginScreen: User cancelled or error occurred
```

### After (Fixed - Working):
```
LoginScreen: Google Sign-In button clicked
LoginScreen: Launching Google Sign-In intent
[Account picker appears - select your account]
LoginScreen: Google Sign-In result: resultCode=-1  ‚úÖ
AuthViewModel: handleGoogleSignInResult called
FirebaseAuthService: Google account obtained: your.email@gmail.com
FirebaseAuthService: Firebase authentication successful
AuthViewModel: Sign-in SUCCESS
LoginScreen: Navigating to home screen
```

## üéØ **Visual Checklist**

- [ ] SHA-1 added to Firebase Console
  ```
  BD:9B:85:FE:93:80:30:5E:EA:62:1C:C3:51:82:AB:95:9F:66:EC:05
  ```

- [ ] Google Sign-In provider enabled in Firebase Authentication

- [ ] Downloaded new `google-services.json`

- [ ] Replaced `app/google-services.json` in project

- [ ] Ran `./gradle.sh clean`

- [ ] Ran `./gradle.sh installDebug`

- [ ] Cleared app data: `adb shell pm clear com.ssbmax`

- [ ] Tested sign-in - Should work now! ‚úÖ

## üö® **If It Still Doesn't Work**

### Check 1: Verify Package Name Matches

```bash
# Check package name in your app
grep "applicationId" app/build.gradle.kts
```

Make sure the package name in Firebase Console matches this.

### Check 2: Verify SHA-1 Was Added

In Firebase Console:
- Project Settings ‚Üí Your App
- Look under "SHA certificate fingerprints"
- You should see: `BD:9B:85:FE:93:80:30:5E:EA:62:1C:C3:51:82:AB:95:9F:66:EC:05`

### Check 3: Check Logcat for New Errors

```bash
adb logcat | grep -i "google\|auth\|firebase"
```

Look for any error messages that might give more clues.

### Check 4: Verify google-services.json

```bash
# Check if file was updated
ls -la app/google-services.json

# View contents (should have your package name and client IDs)
cat app/google-services.json | grep "package_name\|client_id"
```

## üí° **Why This Fixes the Issue**

Your logs showed:
```
LoginScreen: Google Sign-In result: resultCode=0
```

**`resultCode=0`** = `RESULT_CANCELED` = Google Sign-In failed before showing account picker

**Root Cause**: Firebase didn't recognize your app's signature (SHA-1)

**Solution**: Adding SHA-1 tells Firebase "this is a legitimate instance of the SSBMax app"

**Result**: Google Sign-In will now work! The account picker will appear, and after selection, you'll navigate to the home screen.

---

## üéâ **After Successful Sign-In**

Once you sign in successfully:

1. **First time**: You'll see role selection or go to home screen
2. **Close and relaunch**: App will auto-login (this is correct behavior!)
3. **To test login again**: 
   - Open app drawer/profile
   - Click "Sign Out"
   - Close app
   - Relaunch ‚Üí Login screen appears again

---

## üìû **Still Having Issues?**

If after adding SHA-1 you still get `resultCode=0`:

1. Run the test again with logs:
   ```bash
   adb logcat -c
   adb logcat -s LoginScreen:D AuthViewModel:D AuthRepositoryImpl:D FirebaseAuthService:D
   ```

2. Try signing in

3. Copy the new logs and share them - we'll diagnose the next issue

But **99% of the time, adding SHA-1 fixes this exact error!** üéØ
