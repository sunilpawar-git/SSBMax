# üéØ Authentication Issue - Quick Summary

## Your Two Questions Answered

### Question 1: "Why doesn't my screen go ahead of Google authentication?"

**Answer**: There's likely a configuration issue preventing the Google Sign-In from completing. The most common causes are:

1. **SHA-1 Certificate Not Added to Firebase** (Most Likely)
   - Google Sign-In works but Firebase rejects the credential
   - Error code: ApiException 10

2. **Google Sign-In Not Enabled in Firebase Console**
   - Provider not activated in Authentication settings

3. **Firestore Security Rules Blocking User Creation**
   - Sign-in succeeds but profile can't be created

### Question 2: "Once I close and launch again, Google authentication is not shown, and app goes straight to home screen"

**Answer**: **This is CORRECT and EXPECTED behavior!** ‚úÖ

Firebase Authentication automatically **persists** your login state. This is how authentication is supposed to work:

- ‚úÖ Sign in once ‚Üí Stay signed in
- ‚úÖ Close app ‚Üí Still signed in
- ‚úÖ Relaunch app ‚Üí Skip login, go to home
- ‚úÖ Only need to sign in again after signing out

This is the same behavior as:
- Gmail app (doesn't ask you to login every time)
- Instagram app (stays logged in)
- Banking apps (stays logged in unless timeout)

**If you want to test the login screen again:**
1. Open app drawer/settings in your app
2. Find "Sign Out" button
3. Sign out
4. Close app
5. Relaunch ‚Üí Now you'll see login screen again
