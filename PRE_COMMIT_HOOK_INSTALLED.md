## ✨ How It Works

### Every Time You Commit:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Add feature"
🔍 Running security checks...
✅ Security checks passed - No sensitive data detected
[main abc1234] Add feature
```

### If Sensitive Data Detected:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Add config"
🔍 Running security checks...
❌ SECURITY ISSUE DETECTED - COMMIT BLOCKED
🚫 Found API key in config.txt
```

**The commit is automatically blocked** - no sensitive data can slip through!

---

## 🧪 Test Results

### Test 1: Block API Key ✅
```
Created test file with API key
Hook detected and blocked commit
Result: SUCCESS
```

### Test 2: Allow Clean Commit ✅
```
Created documentation file (no secrets)
Hook scanned and approved
Result: SUCCESS
```

## 👥 Sharing with Team

The pre-commit hook is **local only** (`.git/hooks/` is not tracked by git).

**To share with your team**:

1. **Point them to the guide**:
   ```
   See PRE_COMMIT_HOOK_GUIDE.md for installation
   ```

2. **Or create an install script**:
   ```bash
   # Team members can run this
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunilpawar-git/SSBMax/main/PRE_COMMIT_HOOK_GUIDE.md | grep -A 100 "install script"
   ```

3. **Or manually copy**:
   ```bash
   cp .git/hooks/pre-commit ~/pre-commit-template
   # Share the template file
   ```

---

## 🔍 Verification

### Check Hook Status:
```bash
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Should show: -rwxr-xr-x (executable)
```

### Test It Works:
```bash
# This should be blocked:
echo 'key = "AIzaSy_FAKE_KEY_32_CHARS_HERE_TEST"' > test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test"
# Clean up:
git reset HEAD test.txt && rm test.txt
```

### View Hook Log:
Every commit will show:
```
🔍 Running security checks...
✅ Security checks passed - No sensitive data detected
```
