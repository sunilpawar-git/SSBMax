---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Added Navigation Routes ✅
**File:** `SSBMaxDestinations.kt`

**New Destinations:**
```kotlin
// Student submissions list
data object StudentSubmissions : SSBMaxDestinations("student/submissions")

// Submission detail view
data object SubmissionDetail : SSBMaxDestinations("submission/{submissionId}") {
    fun createRoute(submissionId: String) = "submission/$submissionId"
}
```

**Updated Bottom Nav:**
```kotlin
// Added "Results" tab for students
data object StudentSubmissions : BottomNavItem(
    SSBMaxDestinations.StudentSubmissions.route, 
    "Results"
)
```

---

### 2. Added Composable Routes ✅
**File:** `NavGraph.kt`

**Submissions List Route:**
```kotlin
composable(SSBMaxDestinations.StudentSubmissions.route) {
    com.ssbmax.ui.submissions.SubmissionsListScreen(
        onSubmissionClick = { submissionId ->
            navController.navigate(
                SSBMaxDestinations.SubmissionDetail.createRoute(submissionId)
            )
        },
        onNavigateBack = { navController.navigateUp() }
    )
}
```

**Submission Detail Route:**
```kotlin
composable(
    route = SSBMaxDestinations.SubmissionDetail.route,
    arguments = listOf(navArgument("submissionId") { type = NavType.StringType })
) { backStackEntry ->
    val submissionId = backStackEntry.arguments?.getString("submissionId") ?: ""
    com.ssbmax.ui.submissions.SubmissionDetailScreen(
        submissionId = submissionId,
        onNavigateBack = { navController.navigateUp() }
    )
}
```

---

### 3. Updated Bottom Navigation ✅
**File:** `SSBMaxBottomBar.kt`

**Before (4 tabs):**
```
┌───────┬───────┬───────┬────────┐
│ Home  │ Tests │ Study │ Profile│
└───────┴───────┴───────┴────────┘
```

**After (5 tabs):**
```
┌───────┬───────┬─────────┬───────┬────────┐
│ Home  │ Tests │ Results │ Study │ Profile│
└───────┴───────┴─────────┴───────┴────────┘
```

**New Tab Details:**
- **Icon:** Assessment (📊)
- **Label:** "Results"
- **Route:** `student/submissions`
- **Functionality:** View all test submissions

---

### 4. Connected Home Screens ✅

**StudentHomeScreen:**
```kotlin
// Added navigation parameter
onNavigateToSubmissions: () -> Unit = {}

// In NavGraph, connected to:
navController.navigate(SSBMaxDestinations.StudentSubmissions.route)
```

**InstructorHomeScreen:**
- Already connected to grading queue ✅
- `onNavigateToGrading` → `SSBMaxDestinations.InstructorGrading.route`

All routes use sealed classes and parameters for compile-time safety.

### 2. **Deep Linking Ready**
Routes support parameters like `{submissionId}` for direct navigation.

### 3. **Role-Based UI**
Students see 5 tabs, instructors see 4 tabs (different sets).

### 4. **Clean Architecture**
Navigation logic separated from UI logic.
