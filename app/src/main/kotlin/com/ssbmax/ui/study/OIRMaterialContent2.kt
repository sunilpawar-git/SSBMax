# Common Mistakes to Avoid in OIR

Even well-prepared candidates often make preventable mistakes in the OIR test that cost them valuable marks and potentially their screening success. Understanding and avoiding these pitfalls can significantly improve your performance.

## Critical Mistakes That Cost Marks

### 1. Not Reading Instructions Carefully

**The Mistake**: Rushing into questions without reading test instructions

**Why It's Costly**:
- Missing important information about marking scheme
- Not understanding answer sheet format
- Unaware of negative marking (if applicable)
- Misinterpreting question requirements

**Solution**:
- Spend first 60-90 seconds reading all instructions
- Clarify doubts with invigilator before starting
- Understand answer sheet format completely
- Note any special marking requirements

### 2. Spending Too Much Time on Single Questions

**The Mistake**: Getting stuck on one difficult question for 3-5 minutes

**Why It's Costly**:
- Wastes time that could answer 3-4 easier questions
- Creates time pressure for remaining questions
- Increases anxiety and reduces performance
- May leave easier questions unattempted

**Solution**:
- Set firm time limit: max 90 seconds per question
- Mark difficult questions and move on
- Return only if time remains
- Accept that not all questions are solvable in given time

### 3. Changing Correct Answers to Wrong Ones

**The Mistake**: Second-guessing yourself and changing initial answers

**Why It's Costly**:
- First instinct is correct 70-80% of time in aptitude tests
- Overthinking introduces errors
- Time wasted in reconsidering
- Reduced confidence

**Solution**:
- Trust your preparation and instincts
- Change answer only if you spot clear calculation error
- Avoid last-minute answer changing
- Practice builds confidence in first instinct

### 4. Ignoring Easy Questions

**The Mistake**: Trying to solve questions in sequential order, getting stuck on early hard questions

**Why It's Costly**:
- Easy questions at end remain unattempted
- Loses guaranteed marks
- Time imbalance favoring difficult questions
- Lower overall score despite good preparation

**Solution**:
- Quick scan of all questions first
- Attempt easy questions first from any section
- Create your own optimal question sequence
- Return to difficult questions later

### 5. Poor Answer Sheet Management

**The Mistake**: Marking answers incorrectly, skipping rows, or making darkening errors

**Why It's Costly**:
- One misaligned answer cascades into multiple wrong marks
- Incomplete/light marking may not be counted
- Correction attempts create mess
- OMR reading errors

**Solution**:
- Double-check question number matches answer row
- Darken circles completely but neatly
- If skipping questions, be extra careful with numbering
- Periodically verify alignment (every 10 questions)

## Section-Specific Mistakes

### Verbal Reasoning Errors

**Vocabulary Assumption**: Assuming word meanings without being certain
- Solution: If unsure of word meaning, use elimination based on words you know

**Context Ignorance**: Not reading complete sentence before filling blanks
- Solution: Always read entire sentence to understand context

**Relationship Confusion**: Mixing up analogy relationships
- Solution: Clearly identify the relationship before selecting answer

### Non-Verbal Reasoning Errors

**Pattern Forcing**: Seeing patterns that don't exist
- Solution: Verify pattern works for all given figures

**Rotation Confusion**: Mixing up clockwise and anticlockwise rotations
- Solution: Practice visualization; use rough work if allowed

**Detail Neglect**: Missing small but crucial differences
- Solution: Systematic scanning; check all elements (size, shading, position)

### Numerical Reasoning Errors

**Calculation Mistakes**: Silly arithmetic errors under time pressure
- Solution: Quick mental verification; use approximation

**Formula Confusion**: Applying wrong formulas
- Solution: Understand concepts, not just memorize formulas

**Unit Errors**: Mixing up units or not converting properly
- Solution: Write down units; verify final answer makes logical sense

## Preparation-Phase Mistakes

### 1. Inadequate Practice

**The Mistake**: Practicing only 1-2 weeks before SSB

**Impact**: Insufficient pattern recognition, slow solving speed, low accuracy

**Solution**: Start preparation 4-6 weeks in advance; practice daily

### 2. Single-Type Practice

**The Mistake**: Only practicing one question type repeatedly

**Impact**: Weakness in other areas; imbalanced skill development

**Solution**: Mix all question types daily; simulate actual test variety

### 3. No Timed Practice

**The Mistake**: Always practicing without time limits

**Impact**: False confidence; unable to handle time pressure in actual test

**Solution**: Start timed practice from Week 2; gradually reduce time limits

### 4. Not Analyzing Mistakes

**The Mistake**: Moving to next practice set without reviewing errors

**Impact**: Repeating same mistakes; no learning from practice

**Solution**: Spend time analyzing each mistake; understand correct approach

## Test-Day Mistakes

### 1. Poor Sleep/Nutrition

**The Mistake**: Inadequate sleep night before; skipping breakfast

**Impact**: Reduced alertness, slower processing, poor concentration

**Solution**: 7-8 hours sleep; nutritious breakfast; arrive fresh

### 2. Excessive Anxiety

**The Mistake**: Panicking about difficulty or time pressure

**Impact**: Mental block, hasty mistakes, reduced performance

**Solution**: Deep breathing, positive self-talk, trust preparation

### 3. Comparing with Others

**The Mistake**: Getting distracted by others' progress

**Impact**: Lost focus, increased anxiety, rushed attempts

**Solution**: Focus only on your paper; ignore surroundings

### 4. Last-Minute Cramming

**The Mistake**: Trying to learn new concepts just before test

**Impact**: Confusion, anxiety, information overload

**Solution**: Light revision only; avoid new material on test day

## Strategy Mistakes

### 1. No Skipping Strategy

**The Mistake**: Attempting every question in sequence regardless of difficulty

**Impact**: Time wastage on impossible questions; easy questions left

**Solution**: Planned skipping; return strategy; prioritize solvable questions

### 2. Perfectionism

**The Mistake**: Wanting 100% certainty before moving to next question

**Impact**: Time pressure; incomplete test; lower overall score

**Solution**: Accept 80-85% confidence level; move on decisively

### 3. Random Guessing

**The Mistake**: Wild guessing without any elimination

**Impact**: If negative marking exists, loses marks; wastes opportunity

**Solution**: Educated guessing; eliminate 2-3 options first; then choose

## Recovery Strategies

**If You Make a Mistake**:
1. Don't panic or dwell on it
2. Refocus on remaining questions
3. Avoid cascade errors
4. Maintain composure
5. Continue with strategy

**If Running Out of Time**:
1. Quick scan remaining questions
2. Attempt easiest looking ones first
3. Educated guessing for others
4. Don't leave answers blank (if no negative marking)
5. Stay calm till the end

## Prevention Checklist

**Before Test**:
- [ ] Adequate sleep (7-8 hours)

# Mental Math Shortcuts

Numerical ability questions in OIR test your speed as much as your mathematical skills. These mental math shortcuts can help you solve problems 2-3x faster, giving you a crucial edge in the time-pressured OIR environment.

## Why Mental Math Matters in OIR

**Speed Advantage**: Solve numerical problems in 30-40 seconds instead of 60-90 seconds

**Accuracy**: Mental calculations reduce transcription errors

**Time Banking**: Extra time for difficult verbal and non-verbal questions

**Confidence**: Quick solving builds test-taking momentum

## Essential Multiplication Shortcuts

### Multiplying by 5
**Shortcut**: Multiply by 10, then divide by 2

**Example**: 46 × 5 = (46 × 10) ÷ 2 = 460 ÷ 2 = 230

**Why It Works**: 5 is half of 10, making this much easier than traditional multiplication

### Multiplying by 25
**Shortcut**: Multiply by 100, then divide by 4

**Example**: 48 × 25 = (48 × 100) ÷ 4 = 4800 ÷ 4 = 1200

**Quick Division by 4**: Halve twice (4800 → 2400 → 1200)

### Multiplying Numbers Near 100
**Shortcut**: For numbers like 98 × 97

**Method**:
1. How far from 100? → 98 is (-2), 97 is (-3)
2. Subtract cross-difference: 98 - 3 = 95 (or 97 - 2 = 95)
3. Multiply the differences: (-2) × (-3) = 6
4. Answer: 9506

**Example**: 103 × 104 = (103 + 4 = 107) and (3 × 4 = 12) = 10,712

### Squaring Numbers Ending in 5
**Shortcut**: For numbers like 35², 45², 85²

**Method**: Multiply first digit(s) by next number, append 25

**Example**: 35² = (3 × 4) and 25 = 1225

**Example**: 85² = (8 × 9) and 25 = 7225

**Example**: 105² = (10 × 11) and 25 = 11,025

## Percentage Shortcuts

### Finding 10%, 20%, 30%...
**10%**: Move decimal one place left (240 → 24)

**20%**: Find 10%, then double it

**5%**: Find 10%, then halve it

**15%**: Find 10%, add half of that

**Example**: 15% of 240 = 24 + 12 = 36

### Finding Percentage Increase/Decrease
**Shortcut**: (New - Old) ÷ Old × 100

**Mental Method**:
1. Find the difference
2. Express as fraction of original
3. Convert to percentage

**Example**: Salary increase from ₹30,000 to ₹36,000
- Difference: 6,000
- Fraction: 6/30 = 1/5 = 20%

## Division Shortcuts

### Dividing by 5
**Shortcut**: Multiply by 2, divide by 10

**Example**: 145 ÷ 5 = (145 × 2) ÷ 10 = 290 ÷ 10 = 29

### Dividing by 25
**Shortcut**: Multiply by 4, divide by 100

**Example**: 850 ÷ 25 = (850 × 4) ÷ 100 = 3400 ÷ 100 = 34

### Divisibility Rules (Quick Checks)

**By 2**: Last digit is even

**By 3**: Sum of digits divisible by 3 (Example: 123 → 1+2+3=6, divisible by 3)

**By 4**: Last two digits divisible by 4 (Example: 1324 → 24 is divisible by 4)

**By 5**: Last digit is 0 or 5

**By 6**: Divisible by both 2 and 3

**By 8**: Last three digits divisible by 8

**By 9**: Sum of digits divisible by 9

**By 11**: Alternating sum of digits divisible by 11 (Example: 121 → 1-2+1=0)

## Fraction Shortcuts

### Converting Fractions to Percentages

**1/2 = 50%**

**1/3 = 33.33%**, 2/3 = 66.67%

**1/4 = 25%**, 3/4 = 75%

**1/5 = 20%**, 2/5 = 40%, 3/5 = 60%, 4/5 = 80%

**1/8 = 12.5%**, 3/8 = 37.5%, 5/8 = 62.5%, 7/8 = 87.5%

**Memorize these** for instant conversions in problems!

## Speed-Time-Distance Shortcuts

### Converting km/h to m/s
**Shortcut**: Multiply by 5/18

**Example**: 72 km/h = 72 × 5/18 = 20 m/s

**Reverse (m/s to km/h)**: Multiply by 18/5

### Relative Speed
**Same Direction**: Subtract speeds

**Opposite Direction**: Add speeds

**Example**: Cars at 60 km/h and 40 km/h
- Meeting: 60 + 40 = 100 km/h relative speed
- Overtaking: 60 - 40 = 20 km/h relative speed

## Number Series Shortcuts

### Recognizing Common Patterns

**+2, +2, +2...**: Simple addition (2, 4, 6, 8...)

**×2, ×2, ×2...**: Geometric progression (2, 4, 8, 16...)

**+1, +2, +3, +4...**: Increasing differences (2, 3, 5, 8, 12...)

**Squares**: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100...

**Cubes**: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216...

**Primes**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29...

**Fibonacci**: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... (add previous two numbers)
