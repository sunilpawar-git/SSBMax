# Psychology Tests Overview

Psychology Tests form a crucial component of the SSB interview process, conducted on Day 2. These tests aim to unveil your true personality, thought processes, and suitability for an officer's role in the armed forces through projective techniques.

## What Are Psychology Tests?

Unlike conventional tests, psychology tests have no right or wrong answers. They are **projective tests** that reveal your:
- Personality traits and mental makeup
- Thought patterns (positive/negative)
- Officer Like Qualities (OLQs)
- Response patterns under time pressure
- Unconscious attitudes and beliefs

## The Four Main Tests

### 1. Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)
**Duration**: 30 seconds per picture × 12 pictures = 6 minutes viewing + 4 minutes per story

**Format**: Ambiguous pictures shown for 30 seconds each; write a story

**What It Reveals**: Imagination, perception, emotional maturity, hidden desires, conflicts

**Key Challenge**: Write complete meaningful story in 4 minutes

### 2. Word Association Test (WAT)
**Duration**: 15 seconds per word × 60 words = 15 minutes

**Format**: A word flashes for 15 seconds; write the first meaningful sentence that comes to mind

**What It Reveals**: Spontaneous thoughts, word associations, mental speed, thinking patterns

**Key Challenge**: Quick response without overthinking

### 3. Situation Reaction Test (SRT)
**Duration**: 30 minutes for 60 situations

**Format**: A problematic situation described; write your immediate reaction

**What It Reveals**: Problem-solving approach, practical wisdom, decision-making, action orientation

**Key Challenge**: Providing practical, positive responses consistently

### 4. Self Description (SD)
**Duration**: 15 minutes total

**Format**: Write how others perceive you (parents, teachers, friends) and how you perceive yourself

**What It Reveals**: Self-awareness, honesty, balanced self-image, social relationships

**Key Challenge**: Being honest while highlighting positive qualities

## What Psychologists Assess

### The 15 Officer Like Qualities (OLQs)

**Effective Intelligence**: Mental alertness, practical application of knowledge, reasoning ability

**Reasoning Ability**: Logical thinking, analytical skills, problem-solving

**Organizing Ability**: Planning, coordination, systematic approach

**Power of Expression**: Clear communication, articulation, confidence

**Social Adjustment**: Getting along with others, teamwork, adaptability

**Cooperation**: Team spirit, helping nature, working together

**Sense of Responsibility**: Commitment, accountability, duty-mindedness

**Initiative**: Self-starter, taking charge, proactive approach

**Self-Confidence**: Belief in abilities, positive self-image, assertiveness

**Speed of Decision**: Quick thinking, decisiveness, not wavering

**Ability to Influence**: Leadership, persuasion, motivation of others

**Liveliness**: Energy, enthusiasm, zest for life

**Determination**: Perseverance, goal commitment, not giving up

**Courage**: Bravery, facing challenges, moral courage

**Stamina**: Physical and mental endurance, sustained effort

## How Psychology Tests Work

### Projective Technique Principle
When given ambiguous stimuli (vague pictures, words, situations), your responses reveal your:
- Unconscious thought patterns
- Core personality traits
- Deeply held values and beliefs
- Natural behavioral tendencies

**Key Insight**: You can't fake these tests because responses must be spontaneous. Trying to appear "perfect" creates inconsistency that psychologists easily detect.

## Common Themes Psychologists Look For

**Positive Indicators**:
- Helping others in need
- Taking initiative and responsibility
- Solving problems practically
- Showing courage and determination
- Positive outlook on situations
- Teamwork and cooperation
- Social awareness and service
- Leadership and decision-making

**Negative Indicators**:
- Escapism or avoidance in difficult situations
- Blaming others for problems
- Passive or defeatist attitudes
- Selfish or self-centered thoughts
- Negative or pessimistic thinking
- Aggressive or violent tendencies
- Unrealistic or fantasy-based responses

## Psychology Day Schedule (Typical)

**9:00 AM**: Reporting and briefing

**9:30 AM**: TAT (approximately 1 hour)

**10:30 AM**: Short break

**10:45 AM**: WAT (15 minutes)

**11:00 AM**: SRT (30 minutes)

**11:30 AM**: SD (15 minutes)

**12:00 PM**: Psychology tests complete; lunch break

**Afternoon**: Free time or optional activities while psychologist analyzes responses

## How Responses Are Analyzed

The psychologist looks for:

**Consistency**: Do TAT stories, WAT responses, SRT reactions, and SD align?

**Pattern Recognition**: What themes repeat across all tests?

**OLQ Manifestation**: Which of the 15 OLQs are naturally demonstrated?

**Maturity Level**: Age-appropriate thinking and emotional responses

**Officer Potential**: Do responses indicate leadership qualities?

## Scoring and Evaluation

While exact scoring is confidential, generally:

**High Assessment**:
- Consistent demonstration of 10+ OLQs across all tests
- Positive, practical, action-oriented responses
- Mature and balanced thinking
- Clear personality strengths evident

**Average Assessment**:
- 6-8 OLQs demonstrated
- Mix of positive and neutral responses
- Some inconsistencies but overall acceptable
- Potential visible but needs development

**Weak Assessment**:
- Few OLQs demonstrated (<5)
- Predominantly negative or passive responses
- Major inconsistencies across tests
- Personality concerns flagged

## Psychology vs Other SSB Components

**Combined Assessment**:
Your psychology test results are evaluated alongside:
- GTO observations (practical OLQ demonstration)
- Interview responses (conscious self-presentation)
- Overall behavior during 5 days

**Conference Decision**:
All three assessors (Psychologist, GTO, IO) discuss findings. Psychology carries approximately 33% weightage in final recommendation.

## Preparation Philosophy

**Don't Try to Fake**: Psychologists are trained to detect inconsistency and deception

**Be Yourself**: Authentic responses create natural consistency

**Develop, Don't Pretend**: Genuinely work on building OLQs in personality

**Think Positive**: Train your mind to see constructive angles in situations

**Practice Speed**: Time pressure is real; build response speed through practice

## Common Myths Debunked

**Myth 1**: "There are fixed correct answers"
**Reality**: It's about patterns, not individual responses

**Myth 2**: "Psychologist can read everything about you"
**Reality**: They assess specific qualities relevant to officer role

**Myth 3**: "You can memorize good responses"
**Reality**: Memorized responses create obvious inconsistency

**Myth 4**: "One bad response fails you"
**Reality**: Overall pattern across hundreds of responses matters

**Myth 5**: "Only extroverts can clear"
**Reality**: Both introverts and extroverts succeed if they show OLQs

## Keys to Success

**Authenticity**: Be genuinely yourself

**Positivity**: Cultivate positive thinking patterns

**Speed**: Practice rapid response without overthinking

**Consistency**: Maintain natural consistency across tests

**OLQ Development**: Genuinely work on building officer-like qualities

**Practical Thinking**: Focus on realistic, actionable responses

## Preparation Timeline

**4 Weeks Before**: Understand test formats, practice TAT stories

**3 Weeks Before**: Daily WAT practice (60 words), SRT practice

**2 Weeks Before**: Full mock tests, analyze patterns in your responses

**1 Week Before**: Light practice, build confidence, avoid cramming

**Day Before**: No practice; relax and get good sleep

## What Makes Psychology Tests Unique

**No Objective Right/Wrong**: Your personality is being assessed, not knowledge

**Time Pressure**: Designed to get spontaneous, not calculated responses

**Holistic View**: All tests together paint complete personality picture

**Unconscious Revelation**: Reveals what you may not consciously know about yourself

## Conclusion

Psychology tests are the heart of SSB assessment, revealing whether you naturally possess or can develop the qualities required of military officers. Success comes not from trying to appear perfect but from being authentically positive, practical, and action-oriented in your thinking.

**Remember**: The best preparation is genuine personality development, not test-taking tricks. Work on becoming the kind of person who naturally thinks and responds like an officer.

**Next Steps**: Dive deep into each individual test—starting with TAT, the most revealing of all psychology tests.

# TAT Mastery Guide

The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) is arguably the most revealing and significant component of SSB psychology tests. Mastering TAT requires understanding its purpose, developing the right mindset, and practicing the specific techniques that create compelling, psychologically sound stories.

## What is TAT?

TAT presents 12 ambiguous, hazy pictures (11 regular + 1 blank slide) shown for 30 seconds each. You write a complete story for each picture in 4 minutes, revealing your:
- Perception and imagination
- Emotional maturity
- Hidden motivations and conflicts
- Problem-solving approach
- Value systems and beliefs
- Officer Like Qualities

## TAT Process (Approximately 60 minutes)

**Total Pictures**: 12 (including 1 blank slide)

**Per Picture**:
- 30 seconds: Picture displayed on screen
- 4 minutes: Write complete story
- This continues for all 12 pictures

**Blank Slide**: Last picture is completely blank; create any story from imagination

## What Each Story Must Include

### Essential Components:

**1. Characters**
- Who are they? (age, gender, relation if multiple)
- What is their background/role?

**2. Situation**
- What is happening in the picture?
- What is the context/setting?

**3. Thoughts/Feelings**
- What are the characters thinking?
- What emotions are they experiencing?

**4. Lead-Up/Background**
- What led to this current situation?
- What happened before this moment?

**5. Present Action**
- What is being done right now?
- What decision is being taken?

**6. Future Outcome**
- What will happen next?
- How will the situation resolve?
- What will be the final result?

## The 4-Minute Writing Strategy

### Seconds 1-30: Mental Planning
- Who: Identify character(s)
- What: Determine the situation
- Theme: Decide positive theme to highlight
- Quick mental outline of plot

### Seconds 31-210 (3.5 minutes): Continuous Writing
- **First 30 seconds**: Introduction (character, setting, background)
- **Next 90 seconds**: Current situation, thoughts, action being taken
- **Next 90 seconds**: Development, challenges, resolution process
- **Last 30 seconds**: Positive outcome, future prospects

### Seconds 211-240: Quick Wrap-Up
- Ensure story has clear ending
- Add positive outcome if not written
- No time for detailed review—keep writing till the end

## Story Themes That Work

### 1. Achievement/Success Theme
**Focus**: Overcoming obstacles, reaching goals, solving problems

**Example**: Student preparing for competitive exam overcomes distractions and family pressure to succeed

**OLQs Highlighted**: Determination, self-confidence, organizing ability

### 2. Social Service/Helping Theme
**Focus**: Helping others, community service, social awareness

**Example**: Youth organizing relief work in disaster-affected area

**OLQs Highlighted**: Social adjustment, cooperation, sense of responsibility

### 3. Patriotic/Military Theme
**Focus**: National service, duty, courage, sacrifice for nation

**Example**: Soldier completing difficult mission despite challenges

**OLQs Highlighted**: Courage, determination, sense of responsibility, stamina

### 4. Leadership Theme
**Focus**: Leading a team, taking initiative, organizing efforts

**Example**: Team leader motivating group to complete project against deadline

**OLQs Highlighted**: Ability to influence, initiative, organizing ability

### 5. Problem-Solving Theme
**Focus**: Finding innovative solutions, practical wisdom, quick thinking

**Example**: Engineer devising solution to technical problem affecting community

**OLQs Highlighted**: Effective intelligence, reasoning ability, initiative

### 6. Family/Relationships Theme (Use Carefully)
**Focus**: Positive family values, fulfilling responsibilities

**Example**: Supporting parents, guiding younger siblings positively

**OLQs Highlighted**: Sense of responsibility, social adjustment

**Caution**: Don't make overly emotional or dependent; show maturity

## Advanced TAT Techniques

### Technique 1: The Hero Projection
**Concept**: Your main character represents aspects of yourself

**Application**: Create protagonists who demonstrate OLQs you genuinely possess or aspire to develop

**Example**: If you value helping others, create scenarios where character helps people

### Technique 2: Positive Reframing
**Concept**: See constructive angles even in seemingly negative pictures

**Application**: Picture shows person looking tired → Not failure/defeat, but "working hard to achieve important goal"

**Benefit**: Demonstrates positive thinking pattern

### Technique 3: Action Orientation
**Concept**: Characters should be doing something, not just thinking or feeling

**Application**: Instead of "He was sad and worried," write "He was sad but decided to seek advice and create an action plan"

**Benefit**: Shows decisive, proactive mindset

### Technique 4: Realistic Optimism
**Concept**: Positive outcomes achieved through practical effort, not magic

**Application**: Success comes from hard work, planning, help-seeking, not sudden luck

**Benefit**: Demonstrates maturity and realistic thinking

### Technique 5: OLQ Integration
**Concept**: Naturally weave 2-3 OLQs into each story

**Application**: Story shows initiative (taking charge) + cooperation (working with others) + determination (not giving up)

**Benefit**: Consistent OLQ demonstration across all 12 stories

## Common TAT Picture Types

### Type 1: Individual Figure
**What**: Single person in various poses (thinking, looking, working)

**Approach**: Focus on individual's goal, challenge, and how they overcome it

**Theme Options**: Achievement, problem-solving, career aspiration

### Type 2: Group/Multiple Figures
**What**: 2-4 people interacting or in a scene together

**Approach**: Show relationships, teamwork, leadership, cooperation

**Theme Options**: Leadership, social service, teamwork, helping

### Type 3: Ambiguous/Abstract
**What**: Very hazy pictures, difficult to identify clear figures

**Approach**: Use broad interpretation; focus more on theme than specific details

**Theme Options**: Achievement, overcoming obstacles, positive change

### Type 4: Emotional/Tense Scenes
**What**: Pictures suggesting conflict, sadness, or tension

**Approach**: Acknowledge emotion but show constructive response and positive resolution

**Theme Options**: Problem-solving, courage, supporting others

### Type 5: Blank Slide
**What**: Completely blank/white screen

**Approach**: Complete freedom; showcase your best theme and OLQs

**Theme Options**: Your strongest positive theme (usually patriotic or social service works well)

## TAT Story Structure Template

**Introduction (20-25 words)**:
"[Name], [age], [role/profession], was [situation/location]. [Brief background of circumstances]."

**Development (40-60 words)**:
"[Problem/challenge faced]. [Character's thoughts and feelings]. [Decision made]. [Action being taken with specific details]. [Effort, struggle, or process shown]."

**Resolution (30-40 words)**:
"[Outcome of actions]. [Results achieved]. [Positive impact on self/others]. [Future prospects or next steps]."

**Total**: 90-125 words (manageable in 4 minutes)

## What Makes a Strong TAT Story

## Blank Slide Strategy

The 12th picture is blank—your opportunity to shine:

**Recommended Approach**:
- Choose your strongest positive theme
- Create clear, vivid scenario (military, social service, achievement)

# WAT Response Strategies

The Word Association Test (WAT) is a rapid-fire psychology test that reveals your spontaneous thought patterns and mental associations. With just 15 seconds per word for 60 words, WAT tests your ability to think quickly while maintaining positivity and demonstrating officer-like qualities.

## What is WAT?

**Format**: 60 words presented one at a time for 15 seconds each

**Your Task**: Write the first meaningful sentence that comes to mind using that word

**Total Duration**: 15 minutes (60 words × 15 seconds)

**Purpose**: Reveals spontaneous thinking patterns, word associations, mental speed, and unconscious attitudes

## How WAT Works

**Word Display**: Each word appears on screen for exactly 15 seconds

**Response Time**: Write one complete sentence using that word

**Automatic Progression**: New word appears automatically after 15 seconds (no pause)

**No Going Back**: Can't change previous responses; must keep pace

**Booklet Format**: Sometimes given as booklet instead of projected words

## What WAT Reveals

**Spontaneous Thinking**: Your immediate mental associations (can't plan or overthink)

**Dominant Thoughts**: Patterns emerging across 60 responses

**Mental Speed**: Ability to think and write quickly under pressure

**Positive/Negative Orientation**: Overall tone of your thought patterns

**OLQ Indicators**: Which officer-like qualities naturally emerge

**Emotional State**: Current mental and emotional condition

## Types of Words in WAT

### Positive Words (20-25%)
Examples: Success, courage, victory, love, friend, happy, achieve

**Challenge**: Easy to respond positively, but avoid clichés

### Neutral Words (40-50%)
Examples: Book, tree, road, water, table, house, mountain

**Challenge**: Requires creating meaningful, positive context

### Negative Words (20-30%)
Examples: Failure, fear, enemy, hate, defeat, lazy, coward

**Challenge**: Most revealing; shows how you handle negativity

### Action Words (10-15%)
Examples: Fight, run, jump, write, speak, lead, help

**Challenge**: Should show positive action orientation

## WAT Response Principles

### Principle 1: First Thought, Not Best Thought
**Concept**: Write your immediate association, don't overthink

**Why**: Spontaneous responses reveal true personality; calculated responses create inconsistency

**Application**: See word → First thought → Write immediately

### Principle 2: Positivity Framework
**Concept**: Even negative words should elicit constructive responses

**Examples**:
- **Failure**: "Failure teaches valuable lessons for future success."
- **Fear**: "I overcome my fears through preparation and courage."
- **Enemy**: "Understanding your enemy requires strategic thinking."

**Why**: Demonstrates positive mental orientation required for officers

### Principle 3: Self-Reference Balance
**Concept**: Mix of "I" statements, "He/She" statements, and general statements

**Balance**:
- 50-60% using "I/My/Me" (shows confidence, self-awareness)
- 30-40% using "He/She/They/People"
- 10% general statements

**Why**: Too many "I" suggests ego; too few suggests lack of confidence

### Principle 4: Action Orientation
**Concept**: Focus on actions and outcomes, not just feelings

**Examples**:
- ✓ "I take initiative to solve problems quickly."
- ✗ "I feel good when things work out."

**Why**: Officers are action-takers, not passive observers

### Principle 5: Realistic Optimism
**Concept**: Positive but grounded in reality

**Examples**:
- ✓ "Hard work leads to success eventually."
- ✗ "Everything always works perfectly for me."

**Why**: Demonstrates maturity and balanced thinking

## Sample WAT Responses

### Positive Words

**Success**:
✓ "Success comes to those who work hard and stay focused."
✗ "Success is everything in life."

**Courage**:
✓ "I show courage when facing difficult situations."
✗ "Courage is about being fearless always."

**Friend**:
✓ "A good friend supports you in difficult times."
✗ "Friends are the most important thing ever."

### Neutral Words

**Book**:
✓ "Reading books expands my knowledge and perspective."
✗ "Books are boring to read."

**Mountain**:
✓ "Climbing mountains requires preparation and determination."
✗ "Mountains are very tall and difficult."

**Water**:
✓ "Clean water is essential for healthy living."
✗ "Water is wet and transparent."

### Negative Words

**Failure**:
✓ "I learn from my failures and improve myself."
✗ "Failure makes me feel depressed and hopeless."

**Lazy**:
✓ "Lazy attitude prevents people from achieving their potential."
✗ "I sometimes feel lazy on weekends."

**Fear**:
✓ "I overcome fear through preparation and confidence."
✗ "Fear paralyzes me and stops my progress."

## Common WAT Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Dictionary Definitions
**Wrong**: "Courage means bravery and fearlessness."

**Right**: "I show courage when taking difficult decisions."

**Why**: Definitions don't reveal your thinking; sentences do

### Mistake 2: Questions
**Wrong**: "What is the meaning of success?"

**Right**: "Success requires dedication and hard work."

**Why**: Questions avoid committing to a viewpoint

### Mistake 3: Incomplete Sentences
**Wrong**: "Courage - very important."

**Right**: "Courage helps me face challenging situations."

**Why**: Must be complete grammatical sentence

### Mistake 4: Overly Negative Responses
**Wrong**: "Failure destroys people's lives completely."

**Right**: "Failure teaches important lessons for improvement."

**Why**: Persistent negativity is red flag

### Mistake 5: Unrelated Responses
**Wrong**: Word is "Courage" → "My friend is very good."

**Right**: "Courage is essential when facing difficult challenges."

**Why**: Must use the word meaningfully in sentence

### Mistake 6: Overly Long Sentences
**Wrong**: "Success is achieved when someone works very hard, plans properly, stays focused, overcomes obstacles, and never gives up despite many difficulties."

**Right**: "I achieve success through consistent hard work and determination."

**Why**: No time for long sentences; 15 seconds only

### Mistake 7: Repeatedly Similar Responses
**Wrong**: All responses like "I am very good at [word]"

**Right**: Vary structure and approach across 60 words

**Why**: Monotony suggests limited thinking or mechanical responses

## WAT Response Templates

**Template 1: Personal Action**
"I [action verb] [context] to [positive outcome]."

Example: "I show courage when facing difficult challenges."

**Template 2: General Statement**
"[Word] [verb] [positive attribute/outcome]."

Example: "Determination leads to achieving difficult goals."

**Template 3: Conditional**
"A good [profession/role] demonstrates [word] during [context]."

Example: "A good leader demonstrates courage during crisis situations."

**Template 4: Cause-Effect**
"[Word] helps [subject] to [positive outcome]."

Example: "Teamwork helps groups achieve better results."

**Template 5: Value Statement**
"I believe [word] is essential for [positive outcome]."

Example: "I believe honesty is essential for building trust."

## Handling Difficult Words

### Strategy 1: Break Down Negative
**Negative Word**: Defeat

**Mental Process**: Defeat → Not permanent → Learn from it → Come back stronger

**Response**: "I learn from defeats to become stronger."

### Strategy 2: Find Positive Angle
**Negative Word**: Enemy

**Mental Process**: Enemy → Competition → Motivation → Strategic thinking

**Response**: "Understanding your enemy requires smart strategy."

### Strategy 3: Personal Growth Frame
**Negative Word**: Weakness

**Mental Process**: Weakness → Self-awareness → Improvement → Strength

**Response**: "I work on my weaknesses to become better."

### Strategy 4: Officer Context
**Any Word**: Discipline

**Mental Process**: Discipline → Military → Essential → Success

**Response**: "Discipline is essential for achieving military excellence."

**WAT**: 15 seconds per response, single sentences, purely spontaneous

**WAT's Unique Revelation**: Your instant, unconscious associations—harder to fake

**Preparation Difference**: TAT benefits from structure; WAT benefits from genuine positive mindset

## Conclusion

WAT success depends on developing genuinely positive thinking patterns through consistent practice.

## SRT Response Principles

### Principle 1: Immediate Action
**Concept**: Your response should show what you would DO, not just think or feel

**Examples**:
- ✓ "I immediately call emergency services and provide first aid."
- ✗ "I feel worried and think about what to do."

**Why**: Officers are action-takers; thinking/feeling responses show passivity

### Principle 2: Practical Solutions
**Concept**: Your actions should be realistic and implementable

**Examples**:
- ✓ "I call a mechanic and arrange for vehicle repair."
- ✗ "I fix the car engine myself perfectly."

**Why**: Unrealistic responses suggest disconnect from reality

### Principle 3: Ethical Integrity
**Concept**: No compromise on ethical and moral values

**Examples**:
- ✓ "I politely refuse and explain why it's unethical."
- ✗ "I help my friend cheat since he's my best friend."

**Why**: Officers must have strong ethical foundation

### Principle 4: Self-Reliance with Help-Seeking
**Concept**: Try yourself first, seek appropriate help when needed

**Examples**:
- ✓ "I attempt to solve it myself; if stuck, I consult an expert."
- ✗ "I immediately ask someone else to handle everything."

**Why**: Balance between self-sufficiency and knowing when to seek help

### Principle 5: Positive Problem-Solving
**Concept**: Focus on solutions, not complaints or blame

**Examples**:
- ✓ "I analyze the issue and create an action plan."
- ✗ "I blame the system for this unfair situation."

**Why**: Solution-oriented thinking is essential for leadership

## Common SRT Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Passive Responses
**Wrong**: "I would think about it carefully."

**Right**: "I immediately take these specific actions..."

**Why**: Thinking without action suggests indecisiveness

### Mistake 2: Emotional Reactions Only
**Wrong**: "I feel very angry and upset about this."

**Right**: "I stay calm and take the following steps..."

**Why**: Emotions without actions reveal immaturity

### Mistake 3: Blaming Others
**Wrong**: "I blame the system/others for this situation."

**Right**: "I focus on what I can do to resolve this."

**Why**: Blame-shifting shows lack of responsibility

### Mistake 4: Overly Idealistic
**Wrong**: "I single-handedly solve all related problems in the entire system."

**Right**: "I address the immediate issue practically and report systemic concerns."

**Why**: Unrealistic superhero responses lack credibility

### Mistake 5: Unethical Solutions
**Wrong**: "I use connections/bribe to solve this quickly."

**Right**: "I follow proper channels and ethical procedures."

**Why**: Ethical compromise is unacceptable for officers

### Mistake 6: Complete Dependence
**Wrong**: "I ask my parents/friends to handle everything."

**Right**: "I take primary responsibility and seek guidance when needed."

**Why**: Excessive dependence suggests immaturity

### Mistake 7: Aggressive Responses
**Wrong**: "I fight/confront aggressively to prove my point."

**Right**: "I assert my position firmly but respectfully."

**Why**: Aggression different from assertiveness
