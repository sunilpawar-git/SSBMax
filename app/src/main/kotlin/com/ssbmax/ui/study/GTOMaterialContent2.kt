# Command Task Leadership

Command Task is your individual leadership test where you command 2-3 subordinates to complete an obstacle. This task directly simulates military leadership—giving clear orders, coordinating a team, and achieving objectives efficiently. It's the most direct assessment of your leadership ability.

## Command Task Format

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes per candidate

**Setup**: Individual obstacle with helping materials

**Team**: You (Commander) + 2-3 subordinates (other candidates)

**Rules**: Only commander can initially touch/arrange helping materials; subordinates help after setup

**Objective**: Cross obstacle with team and all materials

**Assessment**: Leadership, planning, communication, decision-making, coordination

## The Command Task Process

### Phase 1: Briefing (2 minutes)

- Rules specific to this task
- Available helping materials
- Who your subordinates are

**Your Focus**:
- Listen carefully to all rules
- Understand Start, Finish, boundaries
- Assess materials and obstacle
- Think initial approach

### Phase 2: Planning (3-4 minutes)
**What You Do**:
- Inspect obstacle from all angles
- Test helping materials
- Plan sequence of actions
- Decide subordinates' roles

**Planning Checklist**:
- What's the logical sequence?
- Which material goes where?
- Who does what task?
- What could go wrong?
- Backup plan if first approach fails?

**Your Approach**:
- Systematic inspection
- Visible thinking process (GTO watches)
- Tentative material placement
- Mental rehearsal

### Phase 3: Briefing Subordinates (2-3 minutes)
**What You Explain**:
- The objective clearly
- The plan step-by-step
- Each person's specific role
- Safety points and rules
- Questions welcomed

**Effective Briefing**:
- "Our task is to cross from here to there with all materials"
- "We'll use this sequence: First, Second, Third"
- "Ramesh, you will hold the plank steady"
- "Suresh, you will cross first and secure rope"
- "I'll coordinate from here initially"
- "Any questions about the plan?"

**Communication Keys**:
- Clear, simple language
- Specific role assignment
- Opportunity for clarification
- Confident tone

### Phase 4: Execution (5-8 minutes)
**What Happens**:
- You direct the task
- Subordinates execute under your command
- Adjustments as needed
- Problem-solving in real-time

**Your Commands**:
- "Ramesh, lift the plank from your end"
- "Suresh, move two steps left"
- "Hold it steady... good... now place it down"
- "Excellent! Now next step..."

**Adaptation**:
- If plan fails, modify quickly
- Give new instructions clearly
- Keep team motivated
- Stay calm and positive

### Phase 5: Completion/Time-Up (Remaining time)
**Successful Completion**:
- Ensure all members and materials crossed
- Thank your team
- Stand aside for next candidate

**Incomplete**:
- GTO calls time
- Accept gracefully
- No excuses or frustration
- Learn for future

## Leadership Principles for Command Task

### Principle 1: Clear Communication
**Weak**: "Um... maybe try putting that... somewhere there?"

**Strong**: "Place the plank between these two platforms, at 45-degree angle"

**Why**: Clarity eliminates confusion and speeds execution

### Principle 2: Specific Instructions
**Weak**: "Handle the materials carefully"

**Strong**: "Suresh, hold the left end of the plank at shoulder height"

**Why**: Specificity enables accurate execution

### Principle 3: Appreciative Leadership
**During Task**:
- "Good job!" when subordinate does well
- "Excellent teamwork!" when coordinating
- "Well done, that helped a lot!"

**Why**: Positive reinforcement motivates and creates good atmosphere

### Principle 4: Calm Under Pressure
**When Things Go Wrong**:
- Don't panic or raise voice
- "Okay, that didn't work. Let's try this instead..."
- Maintain composure throughout

**Why**: Leaders stay calm; panic spreads fear

### Principle 5: Inclusive Decision-Making
**Good Practice**:
- "What do you think about this approach?"
- "Ramesh, you're close to that end. Do you see a better angle?"
- Listen to suggestions, decide

**Why**: Good leaders seek input; but decide clearly

## Common Command Task Mistakes

**Mistake 1**: Unclear instructions leading to confusion

**Mistake 2**: Not utilizing subordinates effectively (doing everything yourself)

**Mistake 3**: Blaming subordinates for failures

**Mistake 4**: Changing plan too frequently

**Mistake 5**: Speaking rudely or impatiently

**Mistake 6**: Not seeking any input from team

**Mistake 7**: Breaking rules to complete task

# Snake Race & FGT Strategies

Snake Race and Final Group Task (FGT) are the culminating GTO activities where your group demonstrates sustained teamwork, physical endurance, and learning integration from all previous tasks. These high-energy activities test your stamina, cooperation, and ability to perform consistently even under fatigue.

## Snake Race Overview

**What It Is**: Group navigates obstacle course while physically connected (holding each other or a rope)

**Duration**: 10-20 minutes

**Format**: Entire group must stay connected throughout

**Course**: Series of 6-8 obstacles (walls, ditches, low crawls, balancing beams)

**Rules**: If connection breaks, restart from that obstacle; all members must cross together

**Objective**: Complete course fastest possible with team intact

## Snake Race Obstacles (Typical)

**Low Crawl**: Crawl under net or low structure

**Wall/Barrier**: Climb over wall while staying connected

**Ditch Jump**: Jump across ditch maintaining link

**Balance Beam**: Walk on narrow platform

**Zig-Zag Run**: Navigate around poles/markers

**Tire Section**: Step through tires

**Final Sprint**: Run to finish line together

## Snake Race Strategies

### Strategy 1: Positioning Matters
**Strongest Members**: Front and back (pull and push)

**Balanced Distribution**: Alternate strong and weaker members

**Coordination Leader**: Usually front person calls pace

**Support System**: Stronger members help weaker ones throughout

### Strategy 2: Connected Yet Flexible
**Connection Methods**:
- Holding shoulders of person ahead
- Gripping belt/waist
- Using rope that everyone holds
- Hands-on-waist chain

**Key**: Strong enough to not break, flexible enough to navigate obstacles

### Strategy 3: Pace Management
**Start**: Don't sprint; steady sustainable pace

**Middle**: Maintain rhythm; help strugglers

**End**: Increase pace if energy permits

**Remember**: It's not about being fastest; it's about teamwork and completing together

### Strategy 4: Communication Throughout
**Front**: "Obstacle ahead, prepare to climb!"

**Middle**: "Everyone okay? Maintain connection!"

**Back**: "We're all together, keep going!"

**Continuous**: Encourage, coordinate, support

### Strategy 5: No One Left Behind
**If Someone Struggles**:
- Slow down, don't break connection
- Stronger members provide physical support
- Encourage: "You're doing great, almost there!"
- Team success > individual speed

## Final Group Task (FGT) Overview

**What It Is**: Last group obstacle, usually most complex

**Duration**: 15-25 minutes

**Format**: Similar to PGT but incorporates learnings

**Complexity**: Higher than previous obstacles

**Assessment Focus**: Learning curve, sustained teamwork, maturity

**Significance**: Final chance to demonstrate improvement

## FGT Characteristics

**Complexity**: Combines elements from PGT, HGT

**Materials**: Similar (planks, ropes, balli)

**Challenge Level**: Highest of all group tasks

**Expectations**: Group should show clear improvement from Day 3

**Learning Application**: Directly tests if you learned from previous 2 days

## FGT Success Strategies

### Strategy 1: Quick, Systematic Planning
**Day 3 (PGT Obstacle 1)**: Took 8 minutes to plan

**Day 5 (FGT)**: Should take 3-4 minutes maximum

**Why**: Experience should have taught efficient planning

**Approach**:
- Rapid assessment
- Apply proven techniques
- Quick consensus
- Start executing

### Strategy 2: Efficient Role Distribution
**By FGT**: Group knows each member's strengths

**Automatic Roles**:
- Strong crossers go first naturally
- Coordinators manage materials
- Encouragers support struggling members
- Everyone has defined contribution

**No Time Wasted**: On role discussion; natural division based on 2 days

### Strategy 3: Improved Communication
**Early Tasks**: Much discussion, some confusion

**FGT**: Minimal words, maximum coordination

**Examples**:
- "Standard plank bridge, Amit configuration"
- "Same as PGT-3, modified for height"
- Code-words developed over 2 days

**Efficiency**: More synchronized, less verbal

### Strategy 4: Learning Application
**Techniques That Worked**: Use immediately

**Mistakes Made Before**: Avoid completely

**New Challenge**: Apply creative adaptation of learned methods

**GTO Watches For**: Clear evidence of learning curve

### Strategy 5: Sustained Positive Energy
**Physical Fatigue**: Real after 2.5 days

**Mental Tiredness**: Decision fatigue sets in

**Team Dynamics**: May be strained

**Your Goal**: Maintain enthusiasm, help team stay positive, finish strong

**How**:
- Conscious energy boost
- Encourage tired members
