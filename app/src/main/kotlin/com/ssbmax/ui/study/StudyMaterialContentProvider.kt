**Total Questions**: 40-50 questions

**Question Format**: Multiple choice questions (MCQs) with 4-5 options

**Scoring**: Based on correct answers; negative marking may apply at some centers

## Major Sections Covered

### 1. Verbal Reasoning (35-40% weightage)
Tests your ability to understand and analyze written information:
- Analogies and relationships between words
- Synonyms and antonyms
- Sentence completion
- Coding-decoding patterns
- Series completion with words/letters

### 2. Non-Verbal Reasoning (30-35% weightage)
Assesses spatial intelligence and pattern recognition:
- Figure series and patterns
- Mirror and water images
- Embedded figures
- Paper folding and cutting
- Cube and dice problems

### 3. Numerical Ability (20-25% weightage)

- **Excellent Performance**: 35+ correct answers
- **Good Performance**: 28-34 correct answers
- **Borderline**: 22-27 correct answers
- **Below Average**: Less than 22 correct answers

**Important**: Your OIR score is combined with your PPDT performance for screening. A strong OIR score can compensate for an average PPDT performance.

## Common Question Distribution

Based on recent SSB patterns:
- Verbal Reasoning: 18-20 questions
- Non-Verbal Reasoning: 15-18 questions
- Numerical Ability: 10-12 questions
- General Intelligence: 5-8 questions

## Key Success Factors

**Strategic Skipping**: If stuck on a question for more than 1 minute, move on and return later

**Pattern Recognition**: Develop the ability to quickly identify question types

**Mental Stamina**: Maintain concentration throughout the test duration

## Preparation Timeline

**Beginners**: 2-3 months of consistent practice

**Intermediate**: 4-6 weeks of focused preparation

**Advanced**: 2-3 weeks of revision and mock tests

## What OIR Reveals About You

The test assesses:
- Mental agility and processing speed
- Ability to handle stress and time pressure
- Logical thinking capabilities
- Problem-solving approach
- Attention to detail

## Conclusion

Understanding the OIR test pattern is your first step toward mastering it. The test is designed to be challenging but fair, rewarding those who prepare systematically. Focus on building speed through consistent practice while maintaining accuracy.

**Next Step**: Move on to mastering verbal reasoning techniques to build a strong foundation in the most weighted section of the OIR test.

# Verbal Reasoning Mastery

Verbal reasoning forms the backbone of the OIR test, accounting for 35-40% of all questions. Mastering this section can significantly boost your overall OIR score and increase your chances of clearing the screening stage.

## Why Verbal Reasoning Matters

Verbal reasoning isn't just about vocabularyâ€”it tests your ability to:
- Understand relationships between concepts
- Identify logical patterns in language
- Make quick decisions based on linguistic information
- Process and analyze written information rapidly

**For Officers**: Strong verbal reasoning indicates effective communication skills, critical thinking, and the ability to understand complex orders and situations.

## Major Question Types

### 1. Analogies (High Priority)

**Format**: CAT : KITTEN :: DOG : ?

**What it tests**: Relationship recognition between words

**Approach**:
- Identify the exact relationship (animal : offspring)
- Apply the same relationship to find the answer (PUPPY)
- Common relationships: synonyms, antonyms, part-to-whole, cause-effect

**Practice Tip**: Create mental categories of relationships and practice 50+ analogies daily

### 2. Synonyms and Antonyms

**Format**: Find the synonym/antonym of "BRAVE"

**Strategy**:
- Build a strong vocabulary foundation (500-1000 words)
- Learn words in context, not isolation
- Use word roots, prefixes, and suffixes
- Practice with previous year questions

**High-Frequency Words**: Courage, valor, audacity, tenacity, resilience, diligence, meticulous, pragmatic, etc.

### 3. Sentence Completion

**Format**: "Despite the _____, the soldier continued his mission."

**Approach**:
- Read the complete sentence to understand context
- Look for clue words (despite, although, because, therefore)
- Identify if the blank requires a contrasting or supporting word
- Choose the option that maintains logical flow

**Common Clue Words**:
- Contrast: despite, although, however, yet
- Support: because, therefore, thus, hence
- Addition: moreover, furthermore, additionally

### 4. Coding-Decoding

**Format**: If ARMY is coded as BSNZ, how is NAVY coded?

**Pattern Recognition**:
- Letter shift (+1 in this example: Aâ†’B, Râ†’S, Mâ†’N, Yâ†’Z)
- Reverse coding
- Position-based coding
- Mixed patterns

**Quick Technique**: Write the alphabet and shifted alphabet below it for reference

### 5. Letter/Word Series

**Format**: AC, FH, KM, ?

**Approach**:
- Identify the pattern (gap of 3, gap of 4, gap of 5...)
- Check for alternating patterns
- Look for vowel-consonant patterns
- Consider reverse sequences

**Common Patterns**:
- Arithmetic progression in letter positions
- Alternating sequences
- Prime number gaps
- Fibonacci-like progressions

## Proven Strategies for Success

### Time Management
