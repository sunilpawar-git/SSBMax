                **Important Notes:**

                **After Results:**
                
                - **If Recommended**: Congratulations! You proceed to medical examination
                - **If Not Recommended**: Request feedback (some centers provide it)
                - You can reappear multiple times; many officers succeeded after 2-3 attempts
                - Learn from the experience and improve for next attempt
