/**
 * Cross-platform subscription billing: Android actual wraps Play Billing
 * (`com.android.billingclient`), iOS actual wraps StoreKit 1
 * (`SKPaymentQueue`/`SKProductsRequest` -- see `StoreKitBillingClient`'s doc
 * for why StoreKit 1, not 2).
 *
 * This is NOT a thin mechanical shim (the migration plan calls this out
 * explicitly, "Risks a Senior App Developer Should Push Back On" #3): Play
 * Billing and StoreKit have different product/price-ID models, different
 * receipt-validation flows, and different subscription-lifecycle event
 * shapes. This interface intentionally exposes only the lowest common
 * surface both platforms genuinely share (query/purchase/restore/connect)
 * — it does NOT attempt to unify server-side receipt validation or
 * lifecycle webhooks, which remain genuinely platform-specific concerns
 * outside this interface's scope.
 *
 * `SubscriptionLimits`/`CheckTestEligibilityUseCase` (`shared`) stay the SSOT
 * for subscription *limits* (unchanged by this shim; `core:data`'s
 * `SubscriptionManager`, the original SSOT this doc used to name, was
 * deleted in the KMP-convergence plan's Phase 9d) — this interface only
 * handles the purchase transaction itself; wiring a completed purchase into
 * subscription state is `BillingRepository`'s (app-layer) job.
