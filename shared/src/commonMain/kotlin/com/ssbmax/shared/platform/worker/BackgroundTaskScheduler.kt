/**
 * Schedules the app's two periodic background jobs (previously scheduled
 * directly from `SSBMaxApplication.onCreate` via `androidx.work.WorkManager`).
 *
 * IMPORTANT — read before assuming iOS parity: Android's actual
 * ([WorkManager]-backed, in `shared/androidMain`) gives WorkManager's usual
 * execution guarantees. iOS's actual (`BGTaskScheduler`-backed, in
 * `shared/iosMain`) does **not** — the OS may defer or skip a background
 * task entirely depending on battery, usage patterns, and system load, with
 * no guaranteed execution window. This interface intentionally does NOT try
 * to paper over that difference with a fake "guaranteed" contract; callers
 * that need a stronger guarantee (e.g. a UX depending on a job actually
 * having run) must not assume it did.
 *
 * Per the KMP migration plan's own caution (Phase 4 scope, "Risks a Senior
 * App Developer Should Push Back On" #2): the TAT/PPDT async AI-analysis
 * flow (grading a just-submitted test) is a *separate*, more UX-sensitive
 * background-execution concern that is explicitly OUT of this shim's scope
 * -- that flow goes through [com.ssbmax.shared.domain.service.SubmissionAnalysisTrigger]
 * instead, unchanged by this interface. [scheduleInterviewQuestionGeneration]
 * (Phase 8, KMP-convergence plan) is a lower-stakes, best-effort cache-warm
 * -- closer in spirit to the two periodic jobs below than to real-time
 * grading -- so it belongs here, not on that seam.
