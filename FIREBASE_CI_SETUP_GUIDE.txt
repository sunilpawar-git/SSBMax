# Google Services JSON Setup for CI/CD

PROBLEM:
The CI lint check failed because google-services.json is missing. This file is required by the Google Services Plugin for Android builds using Firebase.

SOLUTION: GitHub Secrets (Recommended)

Instead of committing sensitive files to your repository, use GitHub Secrets to securely provide the google-services.json during CI builds.

STEP 1: Obtain google-services.json

1. Go to Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your SSBMax project
3. Click "Project Settings" (gear icon)
4. Under "Your apps", select your Android app
5. Click "Download google-services.json"

STEP 2: Create GitHub Secret

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Click "Secrets and variables" -> "Actions" in the left sidebar
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Name: GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON
6. Value: Copy and paste the ENTIRE contents of your google-services.json file
7. Click "Add secret"

STEP 3: Verify CI Configuration

The CI workflow (.github/workflows/android-ci.yml) has been updated to include:

- name: Setup google-services.json
  run: echo "${{ secrets.GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON }}" > app/google-services.json
  if: env.GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON != ''

This step will:
- Create app/google-services.json from the secret during CI builds
- Only run if the secret is available
- Keep sensitive Firebase configuration secure

SECURITY BENEFITS:
✅ No sensitive data in repository
✅ Secure secret management through GitHub
✅ Automatic injection during CI builds only
✅ No risk of accidental commits

NEXT STEPS:
1. Follow steps 1-2 above to set up the GitHub secret
2. Push this CI workflow update
3. Your next CI run should succeed

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If CI still fails:
- Verify the GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON secret is set correctly
- Ensure the secret contains the complete JSON content (no formatting issues)
- Check that your Firebase project configuration matches your app's package name

ALTERNATIVE: Local Development
For local development, you still need to place google-services.json in app/google-services.json. This file is already in .gitignore to prevent accidental commits.
