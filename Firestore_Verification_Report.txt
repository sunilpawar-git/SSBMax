# Firestore Content Verification Report
Date: December 24, 2025
Script: scripts/verify_firestore_content.js
Status: ✅ SAFE TO PROCEED WITH PHASE 1

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
✅ All critical content is in Firestore. Safe to delete legacy files.

RESULTS:
✅ 9/9 topics exist in topic_content collection
✅ 36 materials with FULL content (OIR, PPDT, PSYCHOLOGY, GTO, INTERVIEW)
⚠️  16 placeholder materials (PIQ_FORM, SSB_OVERVIEW, MEDICALS, CONFERENCE)
✅ No content loss risk - legacy files also only have placeholders

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DETAILED BREAKDOWN:

Core Topics (Complete):
- OIR: 7 materials ✅
- PPDT: 6 materials ✅
- PSYCHOLOGY: 8 materials ✅
- GTO: 7 materials ✅
- INTERVIEW: 7 materials ✅
Total: 35 materials with full content

Placeholder Topics (Incomplete):
- PIQ_FORM: 3 materials (placeholders only)
- SSB_OVERVIEW: 4 materials (placeholders only)
- MEDICALS: 5 materials (placeholders only)
- CONFERENCE: 4 materials (placeholders only)
Total: 16 materials with placeholder content

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RISK ASSESSMENT:
✅ LOW RISK - Core materials complete in Firestore
⚠️  MEDIUM RISK - Placeholders exist in both Firestore AND legacy files
   (Deleting legacy files won't lose content - same placeholders)

RECOMMENDATION:
✅ PROCEED WITH PHASE 1 DELETION

Rationale:
1. Core materials (35) are complete in Firestore
2. Placeholders (16) are identical in both locations
3. No content loss if legacy files deleted
4. Firestore infrastructure is working

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

NEXT STEPS:
1. Delete 8 legacy content files (~10,000 lines)
2. Simplify StudyMaterialContentProvider.kt (509 → 50 lines)
3. Update StudyMaterialDetailViewModel.kt (remove fallback)
4. Test app with Firestore-only mode
5. Verify all materials load correctly
