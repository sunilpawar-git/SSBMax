## 📊 Executive Summary

### What Was Implemented

SSBMax now has a **Unified OLQ (Officer-Like Qualities) Assessment System** that:

1. **Converts all SSB tests** (except OIR & PIQ) to use standardized 15-OLQ scoring.
2. **Provides a central dashboard** showing all test results in one place.
3. **Uses background processing** (WorkManager) for AI analysis via Gemini.
4. **Ensures process-death safety** through ID-based navigation and Firestore persistence.
5. **Implements data archival** to manage long-term storage and performance.

### Test Coverage

| Test Category | Tests Included | OLQ Scoring | Status |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | OIR | ❌ Test-specific | ✅ Working |
| **Phase 1** | PPDT | ❌ Test-specific | ✅ Working |
| **Phase 2 Psychology** | TAT, WAT, SRT, Self Description | ✅ OLQ-based | ✅ Working |
| **Phase 2 GTO** | 8 tests (GD, GPE, PGT, HGT, GOR, IO, CT, Lecturette) | ✅ OLQ-based | ✅ Working |
| **Phase 2 Interview** | Interview | ✅ OLQ-based | ✅ Working |
| **PIQ Form** | PIQ | ❌ Not a test | ✅ Working |

**Total**: 13 tests using OLQ scoring out of 15 test modules (87%)

> [!NOTE]  
> For a detailed audit of the Psychology tests (TAT, WAT, SRT, SD), see the [Psychology Tests Architecture Analysis](Psychology_Tests_Architecture_Analysis.md).

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### High-Level Flow

```
User completes test
    ↓
Test ViewModel creates submission with PENDING_ANALYSIS status
    ↓
Submission saved to Firestore
    ↓
ViewModel enqueues WorkManager analysis worker
    ↓
User navigates to result screen (shows "Analyzing..." state)
    ↓
Worker processes in background (Gemini AI analysis)
    ↓
Worker updates submission with OLQ scores
    ↓
Worker sends notification
    ↓
User views results with all 15 OLQ scores
    ↓
Dashboard aggregates all test results
```

## 📦 Component Inventory

### 1. Core Domain Models

**UnifiedOLQResult.kt** (`core/domain/model/scoring/`)
- Unified OLQ analysis result for ALL tests
- Contains all 15 OLQ scores + overall rating
- Used by: TAT, WAT, SRT, SD, GTO (8 tests), Interview

**OLQ.kt** (`core/domain/model/interview/`)
- Defines 15 Officer-Like Qualities
- 4 categories: Intellectual, Social, Dynamic, Character
- Scoring: 1-10 scale (LOWER is BETTER)

**OLQDashboard.kt** (`core/domain/model/dashboard/`)
- Dashboard data with 2-column layout (Phase 1 | Phase 2)
- Aggregates all test results

### 2. AI & Analysis

**PsychologyTestPrompts.kt** (463 lines)
- Generates OLQ analysis prompts for Gemini AI
- Enforces strict JSON-only responses
- Requires all 15 OLQs or analysis fails

**GTOAnalysisPrompts.kt** (500+ lines)
- Strengthened prompts for all 8 GTO tests
- Enforces strict JSON-only responses

**Analysis Workers** (WorkManager background processing)
- TATAnalysisWorker
- WATAnalysisWorker
- SRTAnalysisWorker
- SDTAnalysisWorker
- GTOAnalysisWorker (with retry & missing OLQ handling)
- ArchivalWorker (data maintenance)

### 3. Dashboard System

**GetOLQDashboardUseCase.kt** (192 lines)
- Fetches all test results
- Pre-computes aggregations (performance optimization)
- Returns top 3 strengths & improvement areas

**OLQDashboardCard.kt** (366 lines)
- Material 3 UI component
- Two-column layout: Phase 1 | Phase 2
- Color-coded scores: Green (≤5), Amber (6-7), Red (≥8)

### 4. Historic & Archival System

**GetHistoricResultsUseCase.kt**
- Fetches results from last 6 months
- Filters by test type

**ArchivalWorker.kt**
- Runs daily (when charging + connected)
- Moves older submissions to `submissions_archive` collection

## 🔄 Data Flow Diagrams

### Test Submission → Analysis Flow

```
User Completes Test
    ↓
ViewModel: Create submission (PENDING_ANALYSIS)
    ↓
Repository: Save to Firestore
    ↓
ViewModel: Enqueue WorkManager worker
    ↓
ViewModel: Navigate to result screen
    ↓
Result Screen: Show "Analyzing..." (observes Firestore)
    ↓
Worker (Background):
  1. Fetch submission
  2. Update to ANALYZING
  3. Generate AI prompt
  4. Call Gemini (with 3 retries)
  5. Parse OLQ scores (validate 15/15)
  6. Create OLQAnalysisResult
  7. Update Firestore (COMPLETED)
  8. Send notification
    ↓
Result Screen: Display all 15 OLQ scores
    ↓
Dashboard: Aggregate results
```

### Dashboard Aggregation Flow

```
StudentHomeViewModel.init()
    ↓
GetOLQDashboardUseCase(userId)
    ↓
Fetch Phase 1: OIR, PPDT
Fetch Phase 2 Psychology: TAT, WAT, SRT, SD
Fetch Phase 2 GTO: 8 test types
Fetch Phase 2 Interview
    ↓
Compute Aggregations:
  - Average OLQ scores (across all tests)
  - Top 3 strengths (lowest scores)
  - Top 3 improvement areas (highest scores)
  - Overall average
    ↓
Return ProcessedDashboardData
    ↓
OLQDashboardCard: Display results
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Dashboard Shows Empty State
**Symptom**: Shows "Start Journey" despite completed tests  
**Solution**: Check processed data count using logs in `GetOLQDashboardUseCase`.

### Issue 2: Test Stuck in PENDING_ANALYSIS
**Symptom**: "Analyzing..." never completes  
**Solution**: Check `TATAnalysisWorker` logs. Ensure Gemini API key is valid.

### Issue 3: Gemini Returns < 15 OLQs
**Symptom**: "AI returned 12/15 OLQs" in logs  
**Solution**: The system currently autofills missing OLQs with a neutral score (6) to prevent crashes, as implemented in `GTOAnalysisWorker` and others.
