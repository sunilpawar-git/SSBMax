# OIR Architecture

Covers both the **content pipeline** (PDF → Firestore) and the **serving layer** (SQLDelight cache → user test).

## At a Glance

OIR is a 50-question, timed test. A student starts from the shared Compose/KMP test route, passes authentication, subscription, cache-readiness, and question-set gates, then receives a freshly sampled set with this fixed distribution:

```text
20 verbal reasoning + 20 non-verbal reasoning + 10 numerical ability = 50 questions
```

Firestore is the source of truth for content, sessions, submissions, and monthly usage. SQLDelight is the local question cache. `shared` owns the domain, ViewModels, UI, and navigation; `data-firebase` owns the GitLive/Firebase implementations for both Android and iOS.

### End-to-End Student Journey

```text
Student Home
  → OIR test route (`test/oir/{testId}`)
  → authentication and monthly eligibility gate
  → metadata/cache readiness gate
  → valid 50-question set gate
  → durable session creation
  → timed question interaction
  → submit confirmation and one-shot submission
  → durable result persistence
  → idempotent usage recording
  → session finalization and dashboard invalidation
  → result route (`test/oir/result/{submissionId}`)
  → answer review (`test/oir/review/{submissionId}`)
  → fresh Home dashboard
```

The result and answer-review routes pass only the durable submission ID. They fetch result data through their own ViewModels; full questions, sessions, and result objects are never passed through navigation.

## Content Pipeline (PDF → Firestore)

### Design Principle
Keep the LLM out of the correctness path. `questionText`, `correctAnswerId`, and `explanation` are extracted deterministically from the PDF text layer. OIR extraction emits no difficulty label; legacy difficulty fields are tolerated only for backward-compatible reads and are informational in health checks.

### Scripts
| Script | Role |
|---|---|
| `scripts/oir-extraction/oir_extract_v2.py` | Extract the 20 practice-set batches (001–020) from the SSBCrack PDF |
| `scripts/oir-extraction/oir_extract_part3.py` | Extract the 8 topic-family batches (021–028) from `OIR PART 3`; reuses v2 helpers (`composite_figure`, `page_images`, `OPT_IDS`) |
| `scripts/oir-extraction/upload-oir-batch.js` | Ingestion **gate** + upload images → Storage, questions → Firestore |
| `scripts/set-oir-meta-config.js` | Publish `test_content/oir/meta/config` `{contentVersion, batchCount}` — dry-run by default and rejects committed downgrades |
| `scripts/check-oir-content-health.js` | Read-only production verification of metadata, all 28 batches, question IDs/types, totals, HTTPS image URLs, and informational legacy-difficulty counts |

The upload script's `validateBatch()` is a **fail-closed ingestion gate**: it mirrors the error-level rules of the domain `OIRQuestionValidator` (non-empty options, `correctAnswerId` present unless a figure question, answer ∈ option ids, non-blank text) and rejects the write if any question violates them. The Kotlin validator stays the SSOT for the *rules*; the gate enforces them at write time.

### Extraction Pipeline (oir_extract_v2.py)
1. **Page range mapping** — `SET_TABLE` hardcodes `(q_start, a_start, a_end)` for all 20 sets (no guessing)
2. **Stage 1 — Questions** — text layer, sequential marker validation (`^(\d{1,2})[.)]`) prevents false positives
3. **Stage 2 — Answers + Explanations** — text layer, `^(\d{1,2})\.[ \t]*Answer:` regex; inter-entry text = real human explanation
4. **Stage 3 — Figure crops** — `doc.extract_image(xref)` returns clean raster (watermark is text-layer only); images composited onto white canvas at 3× zoom
5. **Stage 4 — Answer mapping** — deterministic: `"(2)"` → `opt_b`, `"5"` → `opt_e`, Yes/No matched to options, multi-answers embedded in explanation
6. **Stage 5 — Type heuristic** — keyword + figure-presence classification; no AI
7. **Stage 6 — Output** — `out/batch_pdf_{NNN}.json` + `out/batch_pdf_{NNN}_preview.html` (human-review gate) + `out/images/set{N}_q{MM}.png`

`questionImageUrl` is written as `gs://BUCKET/...` placeholder, rewritten to public HTTPS at upload time.

### Upload (upload-oir-batch.js)
```
node upload-oir-batch.js batch_pdf_001            # live upload
node upload-oir-batch.js batch_pdf_001 --dry-run  # offline validation only
node upload-oir-batch.js batch_pdf_001 --verify   # HEAD-check all questionImageUrls in Firestore
node upload-oir-batch.js batch_pdf_001 --repair   # re-upload missing images + patch gs:// placeholders
```
1. Validates all local image files exist before touching Firebase
2. Uploads PNGs to `gs://ssbmax-49e68.firebasestorage.app/oir/pdf_questions/` (public)
3. Rewrites `questionImageUrl` placeholders to `https://storage.googleapis.com/...`
4. Writes Firestore doc at `test_content/oir/batches/{batchId}`

**Recommended post-upload step:** always run `--verify` after a live upload to confirm every `questionImageUrl` resolves with HTTP 200. If any are broken, `--repair` re-uploads only the missing Storage objects and patches the Firestore doc — no full re-upload needed.

### Upload Status
✅ **All 28 batches extracted, uploaded, and meta doc PUBLISHED (June 7, 2026)**
- Batches 001–020: 1,000 questions (SSBCrack original sets) + Batches 021–028: 255 questions (Part-3 topic families)
- Total: ~1,255 questions live in Firestore
- Images: All live at `gs://ssbmax.../oir/pdf_questions/` (public HTTPS); the health gate verified 529 unique URLs with HTTP 200.
- Content health baseline: 1,069 valid questions and 186 skipped legacy/invalid records; all three runtime categories have ample valid coverage.
- Meta doc: `test_content/oir/meta/config` is published as `{ contentVersion: 4, batchCount: 28, total_questions: 1255, distribution: 20/20/10 }`; metadata publishers do not own difficulty fields.
- Run `node scripts/check-oir-content-health.js` for the production read-only gate; it performs no writes and requires `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` (or the local development key).

> **Skipped legacy/invalid records:** The production health check currently reports 186 records that
> fail the runtime validity contract (including the known optionless free-response records in batches
> 001–020). They remain in Firestore for auditability but are **skipped at selection-time** (see
> Serving Layer) so they never reach an assembled test.

---

## Serving Layer (App Runtime)

### Storage Layout & Organization

**Firestore** (28 canonical batch documents + 1 meta doc):
```
test_content/oir/batches/
├─ batch_pdf_001..020 (50 Qs each, source = SSBCrack Sets 1–20)
└─ batch_pdf_021..028 (255 Qs total, source = OIR PART 3 topic families)
test_content/oir/meta/config = { contentVersion: Int, batchCount: Int }
```
Each batch doc has `{"batchId", "version", "totalQuestions", "questions": [...]}`. The **meta doc** is
the content-version SSOT that drives client reconciliation (see below).

**Firebase Storage:** `oir/pdf_questions/set{N}_q{MM}.png` (public HTTPS URLs)

**SQLDelight (local cache):** All questions (~1,255 across 28 batches) are **flattened into ONE table** (`cached_oir_questions`):
```sql
cached_oir_questions (~1255 rows)
├─ oir_pdf_s01_q0001 | VERBAL_REASONING      | batchId='batch_pdf_001' | lastUsed=null
├─ oir_pdf_s01_q0002 | NON_VERBAL_REASONING  | batchId='batch_pdf_001' | lastUsed=null
├─ ...
├─ oir_pdf_s02_q0001 | VERBAL_REASONING      | batchId='batch_pdf_002' | lastUsed=2 days ago
├─ ...
└─ oir_pdf_s20_q0050 | SPATIAL_REASONING     | batchId='batch_pdf_020' | lastUsed=null
```
**Key:** The `batchId` column preserves which batch each question came from (for auditing/analytics), but **batches are NOT isolated** — all questions are pooled together.

### Content-Version Reconciliation (Firestore is SSOT, SQLDelight mirrors)
`GitLiveOIRQuestionCacheManager.initialSync()` reads `test_content/oir/meta/config` and compares
`remote.contentVersion` to the locally-stored value in SQLDelight's single-row
`oir_sync_metadata` table. SQLDelight is the active KMP cache on Android and iOS; the former Android-only Room path is no longer part of OIR serving:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `remote.contentVersion != local` (incl. fresh install where local = null) | **Reconcile** — clear all questions + re-download `batch_pdf_001..batchCount`, then persist the new version |
| version matches but some of `1..batchCount` missing | Top-up just the missing batches (idempotent) |
| version matches and all present | Skip (zero Firestore reads) |

So existing installs **self-heal** to new content on the next launch — bump `contentVersion` (and
`batchCount` when batches are added) via `set-oir-meta-config.js`; **no Kotlin change** is needed for
a future content drop. Metadata read failures are surfaced as a retryable cache state; the client no
longer silently treats an unreadable metadata document as a current legacy 20-batch bank.

> ✅ **Release gate status:**
> - Firestore side: metadata is published as `{ contentVersion: 4, batchCount: 28, total_questions: 1255, distribution: 20/20/10 }`; verify with `node scripts/check-oir-content-health.js`.
> - Cache side: SQLDelight stores the local content-version mirror and supports reconciliation, missing-batch top-up, and the two-phase readiness contract.
> - App side: `GitLiveOIRQuestionCacheManager` is the sole KMP implementation; metadata failures remain visible and retryable.

### Two-Phase Latency Model
| Phase | Batches | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 (blocking) | 1–4 | Downloaded before first test can start |
| Phase 2 (background) | 5..`batchCount` | Downloaded while user takes the first test |

### How a Test Is Assembled (Pool Model, Not Batch-Sequential)

Each OIR test is a **freshly sampled 50-question set** drawn from the **flattened SQLDelight pool (~1,255 questions)** — **NOT** in batch order, and **NOT** from a single batch. `OIRQuestionSelector.selectQuestions(50)` works like this:

1. Query SQLDelight for unused questions of each type (ignoring `batchId`):
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM cached_oir_questions 
   WHERE type = 'VERBAL_REASONING' 
   AND (lastUsed IS NULL OR lastUsed < 7_days_ago) 
   ORDER BY RANDOM() 
   LIMIT 20
   ```
   A composite index on `(type, lastUsed)` (DB v18) lets SQLite satisfy both predicates in a single index scan before applying `ORDER BY RANDOM()`. NULLs sort first in the ASC index, so `lastUsed IS NULL` is covered by the same range scan as `lastUsed < threshold`.
2. Enforce type distribution — defined **once** in `OIRQuestionDistribution` (domain SSOT), read by the selector. The bank has zero spatial questions, so the live split targets the three populated types via a largest-remainder `counts(total)`:

| Type | Count (of 50) | Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| Verbal Reasoning | 20 | 40% |
| Non-Verbal Reasoning | 20 | 40% |
| Numerical Ability | 10 | 20% |

   (`SPATIAL_REASONING` remains a valid enum value but is no longer a distribution target.)
3. **Selection-time validation:** `fetchByType` over-fetches (×3) and drops anything the domain `OIRQuestionValidator` rejects, so legacy/invalid records (including optionless fill-in-blank questions) are skipped here and never reach the test — keeping the assembled set at full count without deleting the data. Smart redistribution tops up across the three live types if one is short.
4. Questions are sampled **from the whole pool**, **from all batches**, **randomly** — `batchId` is **ignored** during selection.
5. The runtime `OIRQuestionValidator.validateAndFilter` in `OIRTestViewModel` remains as a **defensive assertion** — post-reconcile it should never fire; if it does, it signals an upstream breach and is logged loudly.
6. Final set is shuffled before presentation.

**Validity is defined once (the domain `OIRQuestionValidator`) and enforced at three layers:** the ingestion gate (write-time, new content), the selector (selection-time, skips legacy duds), and the ViewModel (runtime assertion).

**Example:** A user's first test might contain Q1 from `batch_pdf_001` + Q87 from `batch_pdf_002` + Q150 from `batch_pdf_003`, etc. — a random mix.

**7-day reuse window:** Questions unused in the last 7 days are preferred; already-used questions are only drawn when unused supply runs short. After test submission, `markQuestionsUsed()` updates `lastUsed` in SQLDelight.

### Why This Architecture?

| Design Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| Firestore: 28 batch documents | Tracks download source, version history, audit trail; supports selective re-download |
| SQLDelight: 1 flattened table | Enables efficient type-based random sampling on both Android and iOS |
| Selection: ignore `batchId` | Users get **diverse question coverage** across all 1,255, not exhausting one batch before the next |

### Subscription Limits (per calendar month)
| Tier | OIR tests/month |
|---|---|
| FREE | 1 |
| PRO | 5 |
| PREMIUM | Unlimited |

`canTakeTest(TestType.OIR, userId)` is checked against Firestore before content loading, so clearing the local cache cannot bypass the monthly limit:

- `Eligible` → continue.
- `LimitReached` → stop and show upgrade state.
- `NetworkError` → stop and show retry state.
- Unknown/malformed subscription data → fail closed rather than granting access.

`recordTestUsage()` increments usage atomically in a Firestore transaction after durable submission. Its submission/session identity makes retries idempotent. `markQuestionsUsed()` updates SQLDelight for the 7-day reuse window and is best effort after the durable flow succeeds.

### Start-Gate Decision Table

| Condition | Start behavior |
|---|---|
| No authenticated user | Stop with authentication-required state |
| Limit reached | Stop before question loading; show subscription details/upgrade action |
| Eligibility network or unexpected failure | Stop; show retryable eligibility failure |
| Metadata unavailable or cache sync failed | Stop; show cache retry state |
| Fewer than 50 valid questions or missing a required category | Stop; no session interaction begins |
| Durable session creation failed | Stop; no questions are exposed |
| All gates pass | Create session, expose exactly 50 questions, and start timer |

### Submit Flow
```
canTakeTest()            → Firestore usage check (monthly gate)
  ├─ NetworkError        → retryable error shown (UI stays on home screen)
  ├─ LimitReached        → upgrade prompt shown (fail-closed for unknown errors too)
  └─ Eligible            → continue ↓

getTestQuestions(50)     → SQLDelight query with type distribution + 7-day preference
[user takes test]
SubmitOIRTestUseCase:
  1. scoreCalculator.calculate(session)
  2. submissionRepository.submitOIR(submission)  → durable submissionId
  3. usageRecorder.recordTestUsage(OIR, userId, submissionId) ← idempotent Firestore transaction
  4. testSessionRepository.endTestSession(sessionId)
  5. dashboardUseCase.invalidateCache(userId)
markQuestionsUsed()      → SQLDelight (7-day suppression)
```
A session is created before questions are exposed. Leaving the test marks it `ABANDONED`; a
successful submit marks it `SUBMITTED`; an expired session is terminal `EXPIRED`. Abandoned and
expired sessions are not resumed in the current release. Result and answer-review routes pass only
the durable submission ID, and the review screen fetches the persisted result through its ViewModel.



### Session State Machine

A durable Firestore session is created before questions are exposed. Identity fields (`sessionId`, `userId`, `testType`) are immutable.

```text
ACTIVE
  ├─ user exits → ABANDONED (terminal; no resume in this release)
  ├─ absolute expiry → EXPIRED (terminal)
  └─ successful durable submit → SUBMITTED (terminal)
```

The timer derives remaining time from the session's absolute expiry rather than counting local ticks. Backgrounding, delayed frames, and device clock drift cannot extend the server-defined session lifetime. Submission is one-shot in the UI and idempotent in the repository/use-case path.

### Firestore Data and Security Model

| Data | Canonical location | Client invariant |
|---|---|---|
| OIR metadata | `test_content/oir/meta/config` | Read-only to app clients; content writes are tooling/server-only |
| OIR batches | `test_content/oir/batches/{batchId}` | Authenticated content reads only |
| Test session | `users/{userId}/test_sessions/{sessionId}` | Owner-only; identity and terminal transitions are protected |
| Submission/result | `users/{userId}/test_submissions/{submissionId}` | Owner-only; finalized result fields are immutable |
| Monthly usage | `users/{userId}/test_usage/{yyyy-MM}` | Owner-only; month/identity fields are immutable and updates are monotonic |

Firestore rules enforce ownership, authentication, OIR session linkage, immutable identity fields, finalized-submission immutability, and exactly-once usage semantics. The Compose UI and ViewModels never call Firebase directly.

### User-Visible State Contract

The OIR UI has explicit states for loading, authentication required, limit reached, cache/content failure, retry, active test, submit confirmation, submission in progress, result loading/error, and answer-review loading/error. Active question controls are hidden while loading or submitting. Image loading failures have an explicit fallback state, and timer/navigation/image controls expose accessibility labels.

### Difficulty-Free Result Contract

OIR no longer classifies or displays Easy/Medium/Hard. New scoring is transparent: each exact correct answer contributes one point, incorrect and skipped answers contribute zero, `rawScore` equals `correctAnswers`, and `percentageScore` is `correctAnswers / totalQuestions * 100`. Results show category performance only for categories with questions, plus correct/incorrect/skipped counts, time taken, raw score, and the actions `Review Answers`, `Take Another Test`, and `Back to Home`.

Historical Firestore result documents may still contain `difficultyBreakdown`, and historical answered questions may still contain `difficulty`; the shared DTO mapper tolerates those fields but new serialization omits the result breakdown and no active OIR UI reads either field. Review uses the existing durable submission ID, while `Take Another Test` returns through the normal eligibility-gated start route.

### Key Files
| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `data-firebase/.../data/repository/GitLiveOIRQuestionCacheManager.kt` | Sync lifecycle, content-version reconciliation, and SQLDelight cache readiness |
| `data-firebase/.../data/repository/GitLiveOIRQuestionSelector.kt` | Type-distribution selection, validity filtering, and 7-day reuse logic |
| `shared/.../domain/model/OIRQuestionDistribution.kt` | Distribution SSOT (V40/NV40/N20, largest-remainder `counts()`) |
| `shared/.../domain/validation/OIRQuestionValidator.kt` | Validity SSOT — enforced at ingestion, selection, and runtime |
| `scripts/oir-extraction/upload-oir-batch.js` (`validateBatch`) | Write-time enforcement of the validator's rules |
| `shared/.../data/repository/SubscriptionDtos.kt` (`SubscriptionLimits`) | Monthly limits — single source of truth |
| `shared/.../domain/usecase/oir/SubmitOIRTestUseCase.kt` | Orchestrates score → durable submit → usage → session end → dashboard invalidation |

### KMP Composition

The OIR business flow is shared across Android and iOS. `sharedModule` declares interfaces and ViewModels; `firebaseDataModule` from `data-firebase` supplies the GitLive/Firebase implementations. Android loads both through its Koin composition root, and iOS loads both through `ensureKoinStarted()`. OIR behavior must not be forked into platform-specific ViewModels, selectors, navigation, or eligibility logic.

### Operational Runbook

Run these commands from the repository root after installing `scripts` dependencies with `npm ci --prefix scripts`:

```bash
# Read-only production verification; no Firestore or Storage writes.
node scripts/check-oir-content-health.js

# Preview the metadata target; dry run is the default.
node scripts/set-oir-meta-config.js

# Explicit production metadata publish after review and confirmation.
node scripts/set-oir-meta-config.js --version 4 --batches 28 --commit
```

The health check must pass before a content release is considered complete. It verifies metadata consistency, exact batch IDs `batch_pdf_001..028`, the 1,255-question total, stable/unique IDs, valid category coverage, HTTPS image URLs, and HTTP 200 responses. The metadata publisher rejects content-version downgrades and removes the obsolete spatial distribution field. Never run a production write from an unreviewed working tree or with credentials committed to source control.

### Validation Map

| Behavior | Primary validation |
|---|---|
| Eligibility and blocked starts | `shared/.../presentation/oir/OIRTestViewModelTest.kt` |
| Exact count/distribution/validity | `OIRTestQuestionSetValidatorTest.kt`, `GitLiveOIRQuestionSelectorTest.kt` |
| Cache reconciliation/readiness | `GitLiveOIRQuestionCacheManagerTest.kt`, `GitLiveTestContentRepositoryContentTest.kt` |
| Session lifecycle/timer | `TestSessionRepository` tests and OIR ViewModel tests |
| Submission, quota, and idempotency | `SubmitOIRTestUseCaseTest.kt`, `GitLiveTestUsageRecorderTest.kt` |
| Firestore ownership/security | `FirebaseRulesValidationTest.kt` and rules emulator tests |
| Result mapping/fallback/review | `SubmissionClusterDtoTest.kt`, result ViewModel/UI tests |
| Dashboard freshness | `GetOLQDashboardUseCaseTest.kt`, `StudentHomeViewModelTest.kt` |
| Production content | `node scripts/check-oir-content-health.js` |

### Current Limitations and Release Evidence

- 186 production records are intentionally skipped by the runtime validator; 1,069 valid records remain available, with sufficient verbal, non-verbal, and numerical coverage.
- Abandoned and expired sessions are terminal and are not resumed.
- Question-use marking is local and best effort; durable submission, usage, and session state are the source of truth.
- The production content-health check is automated and read-only. Full first-time and network-interruption journey smoke tests remain manual release evidence.
- `./gradlew check` is the final project gate; a successful focused OIR test does not replace it.

## Applying This Pattern to Future Tests (WAT, SRT, GPE)

1. **Extraction:** Use `oir_extract_v2.py` as reference — text layer for correctness, figure geometry for image assignment, HTML preview gate before upload
2. **Firestore path:** `test_content/{testType}/batches/{batchId}`
3. **Cache:** Follow two-phase pattern in a new `{TestType}QuestionCacheManager`
4. **Selector:** Implement type-distribution ratios appropriate for the new test
5. **Subscription limits:** Add `TestType.{NEW}` case to `SubscriptionLimits.keyFor()` and its limits table (`shared/.../data/repository/SubscriptionDtos.kt`)

---

## Scaling & Expansion

### Can We Add More Questions?

**Yes.** The architecture is designed to scale from 1000 to 10,000+ questions with **zero logic changes**:

| Component | Scaling Capacity | Bottleneck |
|---|---|---|
| Firestore batches | Unlimited (40 batches = 2000 Qs, 100 batches = 5000 Qs, etc.) | Storage cost, not logic |
| SQLDelight local table | Android and iOS devices handle 10,000+ rows comfortably | Device storage, not SQL query speed |
| Selection logic | Works identically | Query still does `ORDER BY RANDOM()` — indexes make it fast |
| Two-phase cache | Adjust Phase 1 count if needed (currently 1–4 = 200 Qs) | Still blocking → background pattern |
| 7-day reuse window | Works better with more questions | More unused questions available |

### How to Add 1000+ More Questions

1. **Extract new batches** via `oir_extract_v2.py`
   - Add new sets to `SET_TABLE` in the script
   - Run extraction for new sets
   
2. **Upload new batches** via `upload-oir-batch.js`
   - Firestore docs automatically written at `test_content/oir/batches/batch_pdf_021`, `batch_pdf_022`, etc.
   - Existing batches (001–020) remain untouched

3. **App automatically downloads new batches**
   - `initialSync()` will detect new batches and phase 2 will download them
   - No code changes needed

4. **Selection logic unchanged**
   - Query still reads from the flattened SQLDelight table
   - Type distribution still enforced
   - 7-day window still applied
   - Users automatically get access to all 1000+ questions

### Cost of Expansion

| Scenario | Firestore Reads | SQLDelight Storage | User Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1,000 Qs (20 batches) | ~20 on first launch | ~50 MB | All batches in ~1 min |
| 5,000 Qs (100 batches) | ~100 on first launch | ~250 MB | Phase 1–4 blocks briefly, then background |
| 10,000 Qs (200 batches) | ~200 on first launch | ~500 MB | Consider increasing Phase 1 batches |

**Optimization if scaling to 10k+:** Increase Phase 1 batches from 1–4 to 1–10 to reduce time-to-first-test.
