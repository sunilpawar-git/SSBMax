Archive index

- What moved: legacy status/release/progress markdowns from repo root are now in docs/archive/root/; the former Docu/ folder is now under docs/archive/Docu/.
- What stayed: active setup/troubleshooting guides remain at repo root (e.g., QUICK_START.md, PPDT_QUICK_START.md, TESTING_QUICK_START.md, PSYCHOLOGY_QUICK_START.md, FIREBASE_*, FIRESTORE_*, API_RESTRICTION_STEP_BY_STEP.md, REQUIRED_APIS_FOR_PRODUCTION.md, SHA1_QUICK_REFERENCE.md, CHECK_GOOGLE_CLOUD_CONSOLE.md, FIND_API_KEYS_SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md, AUTH_*, OIR_SUBMISSION_WORKAROUND.md, SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md, URGENT_SECURITY_ACTION_REQUIRED.md, claude*.md).
- How to access: browse docs/archive/root/ for single-file summaries; browse docs/archive/Docu/ for old MVP/RefreshedUI phase logs and checklists.
- Rationale: reduce clutter while keeping historical context; current docs remain in docs/.
