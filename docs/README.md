## Documentation Guidelines

1. **DO NOT** create new .md files in the project root
2. All documentation should go in the appropriate `/docs/` subdirectory
3. Use clear, descriptive filenames
4. Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
5. Archive old docs to `/deprecated/` rather than deleting

## Auto-Generated Documentation

Cursor IDE has been configured (via `.cursorignore`) to NOT auto-generate documentation files.
All documentation should be created intentionally and placed in the correct directory.
