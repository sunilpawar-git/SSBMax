# üî• Authentication Error - Next Steps

## ‚úÖ What We Know:

1. ‚úÖ OAuth Consent Screen: **In Production** (Good!)
2. ‚úÖ Google Sign-In: **Enabled** in Firebase
3. ‚úÖ API Restrictions: **7 APIs selected** (Good!)
4. ‚úÖ SHA-1: Added to both Firebase and Google Cloud
5. ‚ùå Error: **"Requests from this Android client application com.ssbmax are blocked"**

---

## üéØ The Real Issue:

Since your OAuth consent screen is in production (not testing), the block is coming from somewhere else.

### Most Likely Causes:

1. **API restrictions are still propagating** (30+ minutes needed)
2. **SHA-1 format mismatch** between what's in your app vs. what's registered
3. **The API key itself is blocked** by Google
4. **Web Client ID mismatch** in google-services.json

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 1: Wait Longer for API Propagation

**Timeline**:
- You applied restrictions: ~Oct 22, 08:30
- Current time: ~Oct 22, 09:30
- **May need**: Up to **1 hour** total for full propagation

**Action**:
1. Wait until **10:00 AM** (1.5 hours after applying restrictions)
2. Then rebuild and test

**Why**: Google Cloud API restrictions can take 30-60 minutes to fully propagate across all Firebase services.

## ‚úÖ Solution 2: Verify SHA-1 Fingerprint in Your APK

The SHA-1 you added might not match what's actually in your current debug keystore.

### Get Current SHA-1 from Your System:

```bash
cd /Users/sunil/Downloads/SSBMax

# Get SHA-1 from debug keystore
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android | grep SHA1
```

### Compare with What You Added:
**You added**: `bd:9b:85:fe:93:80:30:5e:ea:62:1c:c3:51:82:ab:95:9f:66:ec:d5`

**Make sure it matches exactly!**

## ‚úÖ Solution 3: Check if API Key is Blocked

### Steps:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Credentials**:
   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=ssbmax-49e68

2. **Click on "Android key (auto created by Firebase)"**

3. **Look for warning banners** at the top:
   - "This API key is blocked"
   - "This API key has been flagged for security review"
   - "This API key is restricted"

4. **If you see any warnings**:
   - The key might be blocked by Google's automated systems
   - You may need to create a new API key

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 4: Verify Web Client ID Configuration

### Check google-services.json:

Your `google-services.json` should have:
```json
"oauth_client": [
  {
    "client_id": "836687498591-7t5p233j00egm3pjv4t1d3ucuo4jfl3q.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "client_type": 1
  },
  {
    "client_id": "836687498591-des9k4qnd3s8imtj8o9ql4c5ppm8mfpo.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "client_type": 3  ‚Üê Web Client ID
  }
]
```

### Verify in Google Cloud:

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=ssbmax-49e68
2. Under **"OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"**, find entries with:
   - "Web client (auto created by Google Service for Firebase)"
   - "Android client (auto created by Google Service for Firebase)"
3. Verify the Client IDs match what's in your `google-services.json`

### If Mismatch:
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method ‚Üí Google
2. Click **Save** (this regenerates the Web Client)
3. Download fresh `google-services.json`
4. Replace your local file
5. Rebuild

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 5: Download Fresh google-services.json

Your current `google-services.json` was downloaded on Oct 22 at 08:00. Let's get a fresh one with the latest configuration.

### Steps:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**:
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ssbmax-49e68/settings/general

2. **Scroll to "Your apps"** ‚Üí **SSBMax Android**

3. **Click "Download google-services.json"**

4. **Replace your local file**:
   ```bash
   # Backup current file
   cd /Users/sunil/Downloads/SSBMax
   cp app/google-services.json app/google-services.json.backup

   # Copy the fresh downloaded file
   cp ~/Downloads/google-services\ \(1\).json app/google-services.json
   
   # Or if downloaded as google-services.json:
   cp ~/Downloads/google-services.json app/google-services.json
   ```

5. **Rebuild**:
   ```bash
   ./gradle.sh clean installDebug
   ```

6. **Test authentication**

## ‚úÖ Solution 6: Try Release SHA-1 (If Using Release Build)

If you're testing with a release build (not debug), you need the **release keystore SHA-1**.

### For Debug Build (Default):
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android | grep SHA1
```

### For Release Build:
You need your release keystore SHA-1 added to Firebase and Google Cloud.

## üß™ Systematic Testing Approach

### Test 1: Wait and Retry (Easiest)
```bash
# Wait until 10:00 AM (1.5 hours after restrictions)
# Then rebuild and test
cd /Users/sunil/Downloads/SSBMax
./gradle.sh clean installDebug
# Test Google Sign-In
```

### Test 2: Verify SHA-1
```bash
# Get current SHA-1
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android | grep SHA1

# Compare with: bd:9b:85:fe:93:80:30:5e:ea:62:1c:c3:51:82:ab:95:9f:66:ec:d5
# If different, add the correct one to Firebase and Google Cloud
```

### Test 3: Fresh Config
```bash
# Download fresh google-services.json from Firebase
# Replace local file
cp ~/Downloads/google-services.json app/google-services.json

# Rebuild
./gradle.sh clean installDebug

# Test
```

## üìã Debugging Checklist

- [ ] Waited at least 1 hour after applying API restrictions
- [ ] Verified SHA-1 from keystore matches what's registered
- [ ] Checked API key for warning/blocked status
- [ ] Verified Web Client ID in google-services.json
- [ ] Downloaded fresh google-services.json
- [ ] Rebuilt with clean build
- [ ] Tested with fresh install (not just redeploy)

---

## üéØ Recommended Action Plan

### Do This NOW (In Order):

1. **Verify SHA-1** (5 minutes):
   ```bash
   keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android | grep SHA1
   ```
   Compare with: `bd:9b:85:fe:93:80:30:5e:ea:62:1c:c3:51:82:ab:95:9f:66:ec:d5`

2. **If SHA-1 matches**: Wait until 10:00 AM, then test again

3. **If SHA-1 doesn't match**: 
   - Add correct SHA-1 to Firebase and Google Cloud
   - Wait 10 minutes
   - Rebuild and test

4. **If still failing**: Download fresh google-services.json and rebuild

## üí° Why "Blocked Client" Error Persists

The error **"Requests from this Android client application are blocked"** when OAuth is in production usually means:

1. ‚è±Ô∏è **API restrictions still propagating** (30-60 minutes) ‚Üê Most likely!
2. üîë **SHA-1 mismatch** (app signature ‚â† registered signature)
3. üö´ **API key itself is blocked** by Google
4. ‚öôÔ∏è **OAuth configuration mismatch** between Firebase and Google Cloud

**Based on timing, #1 (propagation delay) is most likely!**

---

## üÜò If Nothing Works After 1 Hour

### Nuclear Option - Reset Authentication:

1. **Delete all existing credentials** in Google Cloud
2. **Disable and re-enable Google Sign-In** in Firebase
3. **Download completely fresh google-services.json**
4. **Add SHA-1 again** to Firebase
5. **Create new API key** with restrictions
6. **Rebuild from scratch**

But try the simpler solutions first!

**Next step: Verify your SHA-1 fingerprint, then wait until 10:00 AM and test again!** ‚è±Ô∏è
