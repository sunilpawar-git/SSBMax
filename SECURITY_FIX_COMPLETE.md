## ⚠️ Remaining Manual Tasks

### 1. Check for Unauthorized Usage (IMPORTANT)

#### Firebase Console:
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select **ssbmax** project
3. Navigate to **Usage and billing**
4. Check for suspicious activity between **Oct 17-22, 2025**
5. Look for:
   - Unusual spikes in API calls
   - Unexpected authentication attempts
   - Strange database read/write patterns

#### Google Cloud Console:
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Billing** → **Reports**
4. Check for unexpected charges since **Oct 17, 2025**
5. Review API usage in **APIs & Services** → **Dashboard**

### 2. Restrict API Keys (RECOMMENDED)

Even though you've rotated keys, it's best practice to restrict them:

#### In Google Cloud Console:
1. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
2. For each API key:
   - Click on the key name
   - Under **Application restrictions**:
     - For Android keys: Set to "Android apps"
     - Add your package name: `com.example.ssbmax`
     - Add your SHA-1 fingerprint
   - Under **API restrictions**:
     - Select "Restrict key"
     - Only enable APIs you use:
       - Firebase Authentication
       - Cloud Firestore API
       - Firebase Cloud Messaging
       - (Only what you actually need)
   - Click **Save**

### 3. Enable Firebase App Check (RECOMMENDED)

Adds extra security to prevent unauthorized API usage:

1. Firebase Console → **Build** → **App Check**
2. Click **Get Started**
3. For Android app:
   - Choose **Play Integrity** (for production) or **Debug provider** (for development)
   - Click **Register**
4. Follow the integration guide to add App Check to your app

### 4. Mark GitHub Alert as Resolved

1. Go to https://github.com/sunilpawar-git/SSBMax/security
2. Find the "Possible valid secrets detected" alert
3. Review the alert
4. Since you've:
   - Removed the file from history
   - Rotated all keys
5. Mark the alert as **"Resolved"** with reason: **"Keys rotated"**

---

## 📱 Testing Your App

Your app should still work normally with the new keys:

```bash
# Clean build
cd /Users/sunil/Downloads/SSBMax
./gradlew clean

# Build and run
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

If you encounter any issues:
- Verify `app/google-services.json` exists and has content
- Check package name matches in Firebase Console
- Ensure all Firebase services are enabled in Console

---

## 🛡️ Future Prevention

### Pre-commit Hook (Installed)
A pre-commit hook has been documented in `SECURITY_FIX_GOOGLE_SERVICES.md`.

To install it:
```bash
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "google-services\.json|\.firebase/"; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Attempting to commit sensitive Firebase files"
    echo "These files contain API keys and should not be committed."
    exit 1
fi
EOF

chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Regular Security Practices:
- Always review files before `git add`
- Use `git status` before committing
- Never commit files with "key", "secret", "password" in them
- Regularly audit your `.gitignore`
- Use tools like `gitleaks` or `git-secrets`

## 📞 Summary

### What Was Compromised:
- Google API keys in `google-services.json`
- Exposed in public GitHub repository
- Potentially visible to anyone since Oct 17, 2025

### What We Fixed:
1. ✅ Completely removed file from all Git history
2. ✅ Force pushed clean history to GitHub
3. ✅ Rotated all API keys (new service account)
4. ✅ Downloaded and installed fresh config files
5. ✅ Secured private key with proper permissions
6. ✅ Updated .gitignore to prevent future commits

### Risk Assessment:
- **Old keys exposure**: ~5 days (Oct 17-22)
- **Mitigation**: Keys rotated, old keys invalid
- **Current risk**: LOW (if no unauthorized usage found)

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ Build and test your app with new keys
2. ⚠️ Monitor Firebase/GCloud usage for anomalies
3. ⚠️ Restrict API keys in Google Cloud Console
4. ⚠️ Mark GitHub security alert as resolved
5. ✅ Continue development normally
