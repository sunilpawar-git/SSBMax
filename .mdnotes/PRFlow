1. Create feature branch (feature/ppdt)
2. Make changes with frequent commits
3. Push feature branch + create PR
4. Wait for CI to pass ✅
5. Merge PR on GitHub
6. Switch to main + pull main
7. Delete feature/ppdt branch (local & remote) ✅ DONE!
Key point: After merging the PR on GitHub, you don't push the feature branch again - you just pull main and delete the feature branch (which we did automatically last time).
