🎯 Recommendations for Future Test Implementations
When implementing GTO, Self Description, or Interview tests:
1. Data Model Design
Avoid using Map<EnumType, ...> in data classes that will be serialized to Firestore
If you must use enums as keys, always convert to strings during serialization:
  "myMap" to myMap.entries.associate { it.key.name to it.value }
2. Follow the SRT Pattern
Use .mapKeys { it.key.name } for enum-key maps
Reference SRTAIScore.toMap() and SRTInstructorScore.toMap() as examples
3. Testing Checklist
✅ Create unit tests for submission serialization (like FirestoreSubmissionRepositoryTest)
✅ Test end-to-end submission flow manually on device/emulator
✅ Verify submissions appear in Firebase Console
✅ Check that all enum fields are correctly serialized
4. Security Rules
Ensure Firestore rules allow writing to submissions/{submissionId}
Test with actual authentication (not just emulator/debug mode)
