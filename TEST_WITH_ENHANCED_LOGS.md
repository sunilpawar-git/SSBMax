# üß™ Test with Enhanced Logging

## ‚úÖ App Rebuilt with Enhanced Logging

I've added detailed logging to help diagnose the issue. Now let's test!

---

## üìã Testing Steps

### Step 1: Clear App Data
```bash
adb shell pm clear com.ssbmax
```

### Step 2: Start Watching Logs
```bash
adb logcat -c
adb logcat -s FirebaseAuthService:D LoginScreen:D AuthViewModel:D GoogleAuth:V GoogleSignIn:V
```

### Step 3: Launch App and Try Signing In

1. **Launch the app** on your device/emulator
2. **Wait** for login screen to appear  
3. **Click "Continue with Google"**
4. **Watch the terminal** - logs will appear in real-time

## üìä What to Look For in Logs

### Expected Logs When You Click Button:

```
FirebaseAuthService: Creating GoogleSignInClient...
FirebaseAuthService: Web Client ID found: 836687498591-des9k4qnd3s8imtj8o9ql4c5ppm8mfpo.apps.googleusercontent.com
FirebaseAuthService: Using Web Client ID: 836687498591-des9k4qnd3s8imtj8o9ql4c5ppm8mfpo.apps.googleusercontent.com
FirebaseAuthService: GoogleSignInClient created successfully
LoginScreen: Google Sign-In button clicked
LoginScreen: Launching Google Sign-In intent
```

Then ONE of these will happen:

### Scenario A: Success (What we want to see)
```
LoginScreen: Google Sign-In result: resultCode=-1
LoginScreen: User signed in successfully, processing...
AuthViewModel: handleGoogleSignInResult called
FirebaseAuthService: Google account obtained: mail.sunilpawar@gmail.com
AuthViewModel: Sign-in SUCCESS
```

### Scenario B: Immediate Failure (Current issue)
```
LoginScreen: Google Sign-In result: resultCode=0
LoginScreen: User cancelled or error occurred
```

### Scenario C: API Exception Error
```
FirebaseAuthService: ApiException during sign-in: 10
OR
FirebaseAuthService: ApiException during sign-in: 12
OR
FirebaseAuthService: ApiException during sign-in: 16
```

---

## üîç Step 4: Check for Additional Google Errors

In a **second terminal**, run this to see ALL Google-related logs:

```bash
adb logcat | grep -iE "google|auth|signin|api.*exception|developer_error"
```

Look for errors like:
- `DEVELOPER_ERROR`
- `API_NOT_CONNECTED`  
- `SIGN_IN_REQUIRED`
- `Status{statusCode=`

---

## üéØ Action Plan Based on Logs

### If you see "Web Client ID NOT FOUND":
‚Üí Issue with google-services.json
‚Üí Need to regenerate and replace the file

### If you see "ApiException: 10 (DEVELOPER_ERROR)":
‚Üí SHA-1 mismatch OR API restrictions in Google Cloud Console
‚Üí Check `CHECK_GOOGLE_CLOUD_CONSOLE.md`

### If you see "ApiException: 12":
‚Üí Network error or timeout
‚Üí Check internet connection

### If you see "ApiException: 16":
‚Üí Internal error with Google Play Services
‚Üí Update Google Play Services on device

### If logs show Web Client ID correctly but still resultCode=0:
‚Üí **API restrictions in Google Cloud Console** (most likely)
‚Üí Follow `CHECK_GOOGLE_CLOUD_CONSOLE.md`

---

## üöÄ Quick Test Command (All in One)

```bash
# Clear, rebuild, and test
cd /Users/sunil/Downloads/SSBMax
adb shell pm clear com.ssbmax
adb logcat -c
echo "‚úÖ Ready! Now launch the app and click 'Continue with Google'"
adb logcat -s FirebaseAuthService:D LoginScreen:D AuthViewModel:D GoogleAuth:V GoogleSignIn:V
```

---

## üìû Share These Logs

After you try signing in, **copy and share**:

1. All `FirebaseAuthService` logs (especially the Web Client ID line)
2. All `LoginScreen` logs
3. Any errors or exceptions you see

This will tell us exactly what's failing!

---

## üí° Most Likely Next Steps

Based on hundreds of similar issues, here's what will probably happen:

**80% chance**: Logs will show Web Client ID is correct, but we'll see it's an **API restriction issue** in Google Cloud Console ‚Üí Fix: Remove restrictions

**15% chance**: Logs will show an **ApiException error code** ‚Üí Fix depends on the specific error code

**5% chance**: Device-specific issue (Play Services, emulator vs real device, account type)

Let's see what the logs say! üîç
