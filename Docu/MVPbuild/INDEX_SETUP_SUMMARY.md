## 💡 Why This Is Needed

Firebase requires indexes for queries that:
- Filter on one field AND sort by another
- Filter on multiple fields simultaneously
- Combine range queries with ordering

This is a **one-time setup** for performance optimization.

---

## 🎉 After Setup

Once indexes are created, your app can:
- ✅ Show all user submissions
- ✅ Filter by test type (TAT, WAT, SRT)
- ✅ Filter by status (Pending, Graded)
- ✅ Sort by submission date
- ✅ Enable instructor grading features
- ✅ Display progress analytics

---

## 🚀 Recommended Action

**Do this right now:**
1. Look at your error screen
2. Find the Firebase Console URL in the error
3. Copy and open it in Chrome/Safari
4. Click "Create Index" button
5. Wait 3 minutes
6. Restart the app
7. Problem solved! 🎉
