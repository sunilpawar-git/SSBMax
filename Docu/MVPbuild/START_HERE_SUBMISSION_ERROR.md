## 💡 What's Wrong?

**Simple explanation:**
- Your app stores test submissions in Firebase (cloud database)
- To find your submissions quickly, Firebase needs an "index"
- Think of it like an index in a book - helps find things fast
- You just need to create this index once
- Takes 2-5 minutes
- Never needed again after that

**Not a bug!** Just a one-time setup step.

## ⏱️ How Long Will This Take?

| Method | Time |
|--------|------|
| Click error link | 2-3 min |
| Manual (Firebase Console) | 5-7 min |
| Command line (advanced) | 1-2 min |

**Recommended**: Click the error link (easiest!)
