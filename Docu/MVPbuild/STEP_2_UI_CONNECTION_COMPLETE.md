## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Updated StudentHomeScreen ✅

**Added "Recent Test Results" Section:**

```kotlin
// Recent Test Results header with "View All" button
Row {
    Text("Recent Test Results", ...)
    TextButton(onClick = onNavigateToSubmissions) {
        Text("View All")
        Icon(ChevronRight, ...)
    }
}

// Card to navigate to submissions list
Card(onClick = onNavigateToSubmissions) {
    Icon(Assessment, ...)
    Column {
        Text("View Your Test Results")
        Text("Check scores, feedback, and progress")
    }
    Icon(ChevronRight, ...)
}
```

**User Experience:**
- Prominent "Recent Test Results" section after progress ribbon
- Large clickable card to view all submissions
- "View All" button in section header

### 2. Updated InstructorHomeScreen ✅

**Enhanced Pending Grading Visibility:**

**Before:**
- Badge in top bar showing count
- StatCard showing count (not clickable)

**After:**
- ✅ Badge in top bar showing count (clickable → grading queue)
- ✅ StatCard showing count **now clickable** (→ grading queue)
- ✅ `onClick` parameter added to `StatCard` composable

**Updated StatCard:**
```kotlin
@Composable
private fun StatCard(
    title: String,
    value: String,
    subtitle: String,
    icon: ImageVector,
    color: Color,
    onClick: (() -> Unit)? = null,  // NEW
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
) {
    Card(
        onClick = onClick ?: {},  // NEW
        ...
    )
}
```

**User Experience:**
- Instructor can tap "Pending" stat card to jump directly to grading queue
- Visual feedback with card ripple effect
- Count prominently displayed with color coding (orange for pending)

        // Before: // TODO: Navigate to detailed feedback screen
        // After:
        navController.navigate(

            SSBMaxDestinations.SubmissionDetail.createRoute(submissionId)
