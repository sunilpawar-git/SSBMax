## The Problem
You're seeing this error in the "My Submissions" screen:
```
Failed to load submissions: FAILED_PRECONDITION: 
The query requires an index.
```

## ⚡ Quick Solution (2 minutes)

### Method 1: One-Click Fix (EASIEST)

1. **Look at your error screen** - Find the URL that starts with:
   ```
   https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/ssbmax-49e68...
   ```

2. **Copy that entire URL** and paste it in your browser

3. **Click "Create Index"** button

4. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for the index to build

5. **Restart your app** and check "My Submissions" again

✅ Done! That's it!

### Method 2: Firebase Console (5 minutes)

1. **Open Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/

2. **Select Project**: `ssbmax-49e68`

3. **Go to**: Firestore Database → Indexes tab

4. **Click**: "Create Index"

5. **Fill in**:
   - Collection ID: `submissions`
   - Add Field: `userId` (Ascending)
   - Add Field: `submittedAt` (Descending)
   - Query scope: Collection

6. **Click**: "Create"

7. **Wait** for status to show "Enabled" (2-5 minutes)

8. **Restart** your app

✅ Done!

### Method 3: Command Line (For Advanced Users)

If you have Firebase CLI installed:

```bash
cd /Users/sunil/Downloads/SSBMax
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

This will deploy all indexes from `firestore.indexes.json` file.

## 🔍 How to Verify It Worked

### In Firebase Console:
1. Go to Firestore Database → Indexes
2. You should see an index for collection `submissions`
3. Status should be **"Enabled"** (not "Building")
4. Fields should be `userId` and `submittedAt`

### In Your App:
1. Close and reopen the app
2. Go to "My Submissions"
3. Error should be gone
4. If you've submitted any tests, they should appear

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **Method 1 (Click link)**: 2-3 minutes total
- **Method 2 (Manual)**: 5-7 minutes total
- **Index building time**: 2-5 minutes (Firebase does this automatically)

## 💡 Why This Happens

Firebase Firestore requires indexes for queries that:
- Filter data (e.g., get submissions for specific user)
- AND sort data (e.g., show newest first)

This is a one-time setup. Once created, indexes work forever!

## 🆘 Need Help?

**Error link doesn't work?**
- Make sure you're logged into Firebase with the correct Google account
- Try opening in an incognito/private browser window

**Index says "Error"?**
- Double-check collection name is exactly: `submissions`
- Verify field names are: `userId` and `submittedAt`
- Field orders should be: Ascending and Descending

**Still not working after 10 minutes?**
- Try clearing app data and logging in again
- Check Firebase Console for any error messages
- Restart the Firebase CLI if using command line

---

## ✅ After Fixing

Once indexes are created, your app will be able to:
- ✅ Show all your test submissions
- ✅ Filter by test type (TAT, WAT, SRT)
- ✅ Filter by status (Pending, Graded)
- ✅ Sort by date (newest first)

The same fix enables other features like:
- Instructor grading screens
- Progress tracking
- Performance analytics

## 📋 Summary

**Fastest way**: Copy the URL from error → Open in browser → Click "Create Index" → Wait → Restart app

That's it! 🎉
