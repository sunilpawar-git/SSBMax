Wait, if same work, fewer people = more time each: (3 × 12)/4 = 9 hours each, but total coverage = 4 × 9 = 36, so continuous coverage = 36/4 = 9... Actually this is ambiguous. If they work in shifts: 4 soldiers can maintain 12 hours coverage. If working together on same 36 person-hours of work: 36/4 = 9 hours each. But the question asks how many hours 4 can guard (implying continuous coverage with more people = longer total coverage possible): 3 soldiers × 12 hours = 36 soldier-hours available; 4 soldiers working same total = 36 soldier-hours, but spread over fewer shifts means... Actually, let me recalculate: if each soldier has energy for 12 hours, then 4 soldiers = 4 × 12 = 48 hours total coverage possible if working in shifts. But that's not an option. The intended answer is likely inverse proportion: more soldiers = can maintain post longer. 3:12 :: 4:x → 3×12 = 4×x → x = 36/4 = 9. Hmm, that doesn't match. Let me use direct proportion: if 3 soldiers work 12 hours total (meaning the post is guarded for 12 hours), then with 4 soldiers working together, they can extend coverage: (4/3) × 12 = 16 hours.",

That gives QBUSPM. But answer b is QBUSPN, suggesting L→N (+2). The most consistent pattern with the given code is alternating +1, +2: P→Q(+1), A→B(+1), T→U(+1), R→S(+1), O→P(+1), L→N(+2).

But since answer b QBUSPN is given, the last letter L→N suggests +2 or the pattern varies. Given typical OIR questions, the most likely answer intended is simple Caesar shift +1, making answer a correct, but answer b is listed, so there might be a typo in my encoding.
